My name is Robert Kincaid, and the great National Geographic Magazine has sent me out to take pictures of these famous covered bridges you've got here. Except my editor told me there were seven of them, and I can only find six. This last one...\\n\\nFrancesca: The Roseman Bridge, I bet.\\n\\n> Robert: Yes, that's the one. I'd be grateful if you just tell me where the bridge is, that's all.\\n\\nFrancesca: It's not far, but the locals have taken down all the signs. Kind of a joke, I guess.\\n\\n(A car goes by and honks. Francesca smiles and waves.)\\n\\n> Robert: You're not a local?\\n\\nFrancesca: I live here. With my husband and kids. But – (A bit surprised) I'm not from here, no.\\n\\n> Robert: Your accent is Italian. I was in Naples just a little while ago.\\n\\nFrancesca: You were?\\n\\n> Robert: Uh-huh. Now to get to this Bridge...\\n\\n(The mention of home made her feel funny for a moment. But she gets hold of herself and gives the directions)\\n\\nFrancesca: okay. To get to the Roseman Bridge from here, you head away from town and take a left at the third brown barn.\\n\\n> Robert: (Laughs) Third brown barn. You know what? I only needed to be there for five minutes, it's too late to shoot today. So I think I'll just go check into the Motor Court and start again in the morning. I'm sorry I bothered you.\\n\\nFrancesca: It's the brown barn with a bright blue silo beside it.\\n\\n> Robert: Oh, OK. I remember seeing that.\\n\\nFrancesca: Then after the barn, turn left, and go around the tractor, which John leaves on the road this time of year.\\n\\n> Robert: On the unmarked dirt road.\\n\\nFrancesca: It sounds worse than it is. If it would help, I can drive over there and you can follow me in your truck.\\n\\n> Robert: No, no. I don't want to be any trouble.\\n\\nFrancesca: It's no trouble, I was going to the library anyway, (Looking at her watch) but it's closed now, so–if you're really only going to be there five minutes, there's no point to even taking two cars. I'll just ride with you, and then you can bring me back here on your way to the Motor Court.\\n\\n> Robert: Thanks. That's great. Thank you.\\n\\nFrancesca: It's alright. When I first moved here, I got lost everyday. I'm Francesca.\\n\\n(They shake hands. Music starts)\\n\\n> Robert: Much obliged.\\n\\n(They walked to the truck.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Where are you from, Mr. Kincaid? You sound like you might be Southern.\\n\\n> Robert: I was born in Texas, but I live in Seattle now.\\n\\n(Arriving at the truck)\\n\\nI'm sorry this truck is such a mess. Long trip like this I kind of live in it, so she gets real...\\n\\n(He opens the door and closes it)\\n\\nFrancesca: You just drove halfway across the country?\\n\\n(He seems relieved to be asked to a real question)\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nI left eight days ago from Washington.  \\nI've got a place there on the sound.  \\nTook route 2 east out of Spokane.  \\nOh, this old truck, she's been around.  \\nWent through Kalispell and North Dakota,  \\nHit Minnesota on the way.  \\nWent around Lake superior,  \\nHit Des Moines earlier today.  \\n  \\nAnd I've been looking for something  \\nAt ev'ry bridge that I crossed,  \\nAnd sometimes you can feel  \\nLike time becomes unreal  \\nWhen you are temporarily lost.\\n\\nFrancesca: Right, go right. I'm sorry\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nYou spend your time behind the camera,  \\nSometimes you almost disappear.  \\nYou see a waterfall in Cameroon,  \\nAnd start to wonder why we are here.  \\nYou've gotta touch it with your fingers,  \\nAnd feel the way the water flows  \\nUntil you figure out the meaning.  \\nAt least, I think that's how it goes.  \\n  \\nSo I've been looking for something,  \\nAnd who can reckon the cost?  \\nYou chase it every day.  \\nYou think you're on your way,  \\nAnd then you're temporarily lost.  \\n\\nFrancesca: There it is. Just around the curve. Roseman Bridge.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAnd now, it seems to me  \\nThe way you find the key  \\nIs to be temporarily lost.  \\n\\n### At Roseman Bridge\\n\\n(He pulls the truck over and stops)\\n\\n> Robert: (Seeing the bridge) Oh now, that's a beauty. Be perfect for a sunrise shot in the morning. (Opening his door) I'd like to do a little recon right now if you don't mind.\\n\\nFrancesca: I'm fine. I haven't been over here for a long time. I'll just wait here.\\n\\n(She watches him as he approaches and examines the bridge. At some point, she finds a pad of paper from her purse into pencil and begins to sketch.)\\n\\n> Robert: I know I said five minutes, but it could be more like ten.\\n\\nFrancesca: Take your time.\\n\\n> Robert: Then I'll drive you back home.\\n\\n\\nFrancesca: ...  \\nComes someone so ridiculous,  \\nSo earnest,  \\nSo strong?\\n\\n(It's clear enough that these are two great-looking people on either side of the bridge, in this bridge will be crossed. He returns from the bridge, get the car.)\\n\\n> Robert: There we go. All done. You ready? (A beat, then:) Just give me one second. (He takes a final look, then the drive home.)\\n\\nFrancesca: ...  \\nSomething holy—  \\nSomething newly born  \\nWithout a name.\\n\\n> Robert: What were you doing? Sketching the bridge?\\n\\nFrancesca: No, no. Grocery list.\\n\\n### At Francesca's house\\n\\nFrancesca: Just drive around to the back.\\n\\n> Robert: The back.\\n\\nFrancesca: You can park in the shade there while I get us a glass of tea.\\n\\n(He stops the truck)\\n\\n> Robert: I should get going.\\n\\nFrancesca: I know, but aren't you hot? And the tea is already made.\\n\\n> Robert: All right, then. (Then quickly) But I need to keep my film as cool as I can. You don't have any extra ice, do you?\\n\\nFrancesca: You can put your film in the fridge if you want. I read that photographers have to do that sometimes.\\n\\n> Robert: I'll just fill the cooler with ice. Thank you, though. (He gets his cooler and followed her into the house.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Okay. Come on in.\\n\\n### Inside the house\\n\\n(He sets down his cooler, not quite knowing what to expect. Then he watches as she takes her boots off, and pours them each a glass of tea.)\\n\\nFrancesca: I hope you like your tea with sugar.\\n\\n> Robert: I do.\\n\\n(She drinks her is down quickly)\\n\\nFrancesca: Ah.\\n\\n> Robert: Is that what you do first when you come in the house? Take off your shoes?\\n\\nFrancesca: I guess I do. Not you, I see.\\n\\n> Robert: No ma'am. Real cowboy's supposed to die with his boots *on* if he can.\\n\\nFrancesca: Is that how you think of yourself, as a cowboy? (She pours more tea)\\n\\n> Robert: Not really. I don't know why it said that.\\n\\n(Then suddenly, she remembers the film.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Oh the ice! (Opening the freezer section) I was so thirsty I forgot about the ice for your film. (She pulls out eight trays)\\n\\n(He brings the cooler to the fridge and they open ice cube trays – the old metal kind. This makes a lot of noise, and these trays are very cold. She makes a little yelp as the first one.)\\n\\n> Robert: Wait. Let me help. These ice trays stick to your fingers worse than the ice. (And sure enough, he has some kind of trick that makes the ice cubes come out perfectly. She stands back and watches as he feels his cooler, picks the whole thing up and heads outside.) That should do it. I'll just go get my film.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nMichael: Is that what you're going to do? Call mom for the rest of your life?\\n\\n(Robert reenters. He has a six pack of beer and has on a clean shirt.)\\n\\n> Robert: Trouble?\\n\\nFrancesca: No, no. Caroline and Michael are with their dad on their way to the Indiana State fair. It's the 4H national finals and Caroline has a very good chance of– (Stopping herself) I'm sorry. My children are at a gas station arguing about who gets to wear the lucky red shirt.\\n\\n> Robert: And you said the girl should get the shirt.\\n\\nFrancesca: I did. How did you know?\\n\\n> Robert: Boy should have to work for his luck. Girls need it more, with everything they're up against. (She notices the beer) I had some beer in the cooler. I thought you might like to join me.\\n\\nFrancesca: That sounds good, actually.\\n\\n> Robert: OK, then. One beer and then I'll leave you to your peace and quiet.\\n\\nFrancesca: You washed up and put on a clean shirt.\\n\\n> Robert: I did. You can't count on those Motor Court showers. I figured I'd clean up while I had the chance. Here you go. (Hands her a beer)\\n\\nFrancesca: What do you mean, with everything girls are up against?\\n\\n> Robert: I guess it's just some of the stuff I've seen in the world. (Stopping himself) I shouldn't have said anything.\\n\\nFrancesca: No, please.\\n\\n> Robert: Truth is, I started to just drive off in the truck, but then I thought that would be rude, after you were so nice to me, so I came back in. But I warn you, I am not very good company.\\n\\nFrancesca: I'm glad you didn't leave. I was hoping maybe you'd show me some pictures of Naples. That's where I'm from. (Sensing his reluctance) Didn't you say you were in Naples recently?\\n\\n> Robert: I was. But I'm not sure I have those with me. (There is an uncomfortable silence, then) But I appreciate... all this. (Now a toast) To the National Geographic.\\n\\nFrancesca: To the National Geographic. (They clink bottles. Then drink.)\\n\\n> Robert: I've never been to the real middle of the country like this. It feels really empty.\\n\\nFrancesca: I know. It's not what I dreamed of as a girl. But it's very quiet here. And the people are nice. Bud told me when we first met–\\n\\n> Robert: Is that what you call your husband? Bud? The mailbox says Richard Johnson.\\n\\nFrancesca: Bud's what everybody's call him since he was a boy.\\n\\n> Robert: So \\\"Bud\\\" told you when you met –\\n\\nFrancesca: ... (Song)\\n\\nBud:  \\nYou're never alone.  \\n(Then Bud leaves the stage and Robert and Francesca are alone)\\n\\n> Robert: So the houses might look empty, but they're not.\\n\\nFrancesca: No, no. Everybody is either working, or... looking out their windows.\\n\\n> Robert: Well. I guess that's my cue to go. Wouldn't want to your neighbors coming over to ask what my truck's doing in your backyard. I saw two restaurants in town for supper. Is either one of them–\\n\\nFrancesca: Oh no. I wasn't thinking. Both those places are closed now. In the motor court only has a vending machine. There's really no place for you to eat until... Des Moines, and they might be closed by the time you get there.\\n\\n> Robert: It's okay. I've got some carrots in the truck. Coupla apples, that'll do. What time does everybody open up for breakfast?\\n\\nFrancesca: Early. But that's when you want to be taking your pictures.\\n\\n> Robert: Okay then. I better get going.\\n\\nFrancesca: (She knows he won't make it) No, no. It's too late. Why don't I make you dinner, we could eat together, I mean. I can make pork chops and vegetables...\\n\\n> Robert: No, no. I can't. I'm good. (He stands as if to go. A moment)\\n\\nFrancesca: Mr. Kincaid. In Italy we would never let anybody leave hungry.\\n\\n> Robert: I know that alright. I never ate food like that in my whole life. Is there something you Italians know that the rest of us don't?\\n\\nFrancesca: Maybe.\\n\\n> Robert: Okay then. I accept. But just vegetables for me. I don't eat meat anymore. It's not a big deal. I just feel better when I don't. Tell me what I can do.\\n\\nFrancesca: Just go out to the garden and pick whatever looks good. Will make a vegetables do with dumplings. And salad. I'll get cleaned up and meet you right back here.\\n\\n> Robert: Sounds good.\\n\\n----------\\n\\n### Back in Francesca's kitchen\\n\\n(Robert is rinsing vegetables at the sink as she comes down the stairs. He has brought a beat-up acoustic guitar into the house with him and leaned against the wall she's wearing a clean pair of jeans and a white shirt, the sleeves rolled up, and sandals.)\\n\\n(He turns around to look at her. He's knocked out by her beauty, and starts to say so. That changes his mind. She still smells of the shower and he's doing good to speak at all.)\\n\\n> Robert: You... You've got an amazing garden.\\n\\nFrancesca: Thank you. (Then notices guitar) Oh good. You brought in your guitar. I saw it in the back of the truck. I was hoping you maybe play something for me. I never get to hear any real music.\\n\\n> Robert: The guitar's not really mine. Well, I guess it is now. I mean, it belonged to my ex-wife, Marian. I can't play worth a damn, but it's not good to leave it outside. I don't want it in my house, though, and I can't leave it in the truck. So I don't know *what* to do with it.\\n\\nFrancesca: Well, that's probably why she gave it to you.\\n\\n> Robert: I don't understand.\\n\\nFrancesca: So you wouldn't forget her. Let's see what you've found for supper.\\n\\n> Robert: (Drying his hands) It's all washed and ready. Squash, leeks, potatoes, carrots, fennel, basil, tomatoes.\\n\\nFrancesca: My Poppa liked fennel. I think I'm the only person in this county who even grows it.\\n\\n> Robert: I had this amazing soup in Italy, in a tiny little town somewhere. I tried to remember what was in it, and just picked that. I could be wrong about the leeks, but I know there was fennel.\\n\\nFrancesca: I can make you that soup.\\n\\n> Robert: So I did OK.\\n\\nFrancesca: (Teasing him) No kale, I see.\\n\\n> Robert: I don't like kale. Was I supposed to get kale?\\n\\nFrancesca: No. It's kind of an American thing.\\n\\n> Robert: How about another beer?\\n\\nFrancesca: I'm sorry I don't have anything else for us to drink. Though... There might be a bottle of brandy in that cupboard, if you want to look.\\n\\n> Robert: I could use a brandy. This cupboard?\\n\\nFrancesca: I'll get it.\\n\\n(She puts down her knife and grabs the kitchen chair. With his help, she gets out on the chair and pushes things around in the upper cupboard until she finds the brandy.)\\n\\n(Handing it to him)\\n\\nHere it is. I hope it's still good.\\n\\n> Robert: I'm sure it will be. It hasn't even been opened. How did it get there?\\n\\nFrancesca: Oh I bought it once, a couple of years ago, thinking... (Decides not to tell) Thinking we might enjoy it. But I guess we never got around to it.\\n\\n> Robert: And do you still think you might enjoy it?\\n\\nFrancesca: I wanted to know what it tasted like.\\n\\n> Robert: Well then. There's no time like the present. (He opens the bottle, looks in the cupboard, find two glasses and pours them each a drink.)\\n\\nFrancesca: I thought it was an after dinner drink.\\n\\n> Robert: Well normally it is, but after dinner tonight, I'm going to drive back to the Motor Court, so I can be at that bridge at dawn. And I think this bottle has waited long enough.\\n\\nFrancesca: All right then. (They clink glasses again and she takes to sip) Oh my goodness. Is this what it's supposed to taste like?\\n\\n> Robert: Exactly.\\n\\nFrancesca: I like how it burns a little, at the end.\\n\\n> Robert: You picked a good one.\\n\\nFrancesca: Are you still in touch with your ex-wife? Marian?\\n\\n> Robert: No. And I don't know if my parents are alive, or where my brothers and sisters are...\\n\\nFrancesca: I didn't mean to pry.\\n\\n> Robert: I keep to myself, that's all. (Then realizing she's looking at him) But I don't want to be rude. So. Ask away.\\n\\nFrancesca: Skin these carrots. Was your ex-wife a photographer to?\\n\\n> Robert: No, she was a waitress... Who wanted to be a singer, or some kind of something else. She was young though, so... Who knows what she is now.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: I think it needs a little more pepper, what do you think.\\n\\n> Robert: Do you have a...\\n\\nFrancesca: Pepper grinder, I sure do. (She opens the cabinet and gets it)\\n\\n> Robert: You brought this with you from home.\\n\\nFrancesca: I did. And a box of mamas recipes. I could make real mozzarella if anybody in Iowa would eat it. (Then looks at him) You would eat it.\\n\\n> Robert: With tomatoes and basil, you bet I would.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nMarian:  \\nAnother life.  \\nAnother life.\\n\\n> Robert: That was a great supper. Let me clear the table.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: Everything's fine. I love you. (She hangs up the phone and Robert takes a sip from the stew) That was my husband.\\n\\n(Robert is listening up a little. He tries a question.)\\n\\n> Robert: Why didn't you go with them? (He pours them another brandy.)\\n\\nFrancesca: They have a better time without me. Take hundreds of pictures of the stairs. So I just can just watch this slideshow when they get back. \\\"Mom, mom, look at this pig!\\\" OK. \\\"And this watermelon.\\\" Wow. It's as big as the pig.\\n\\n> Robert: It's hard to take a good picture. Sometimes I see tourists taking pictures and I want to say, \\\"get closer,\\\" you know? \\\"Move in on the thing so we can see it.\\\" And turn your camera up to vertical, especially if you're taking pictures of people. People are vertical. Usually. (A beat) Are you an artist? I thought your sketch of the bridge was good.\\n\\nFrancesca: Drawing is what I studied in school. It's all I ever wanted to do.\\n\\n> Robert: But you got married and moved to Iowa and...\\n\\nFrancesca: And now I'm just draw for myself, when I have time.\\n\\n> Robert: I'll wash the dishes if you want. You dry.\\n\\nFrancesca: No, no. I'll do them after you go.\\n\\n> Robert: (He smiles) Okay. Roseman Bridge at dawn. I better get going. (He grabs his backpack and any cameras he brought into the house. They walked to the back door.)\\n\\nFrancesca: I enjoyed talking with you.\\n\\n> Robert: Thanks again for everything. But especially that wonderful supper. I don't remember the last time anybody cooked for me. And I was thinking maybe if you kept that brandy at the front of the cupboard, or even out on the counter, you might get a little more enjoyment out of it.\\n\\nFrancesca: I'll try that. Good night. Take care.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nA little twinge,  \\nA little shock,  \\nA little whisper at the bottom of your memory.  \\nA sudden wind,  \\nA gentle knock,  \\nAnd then a russell in the leaves.  \\nYou hold your breath,  \\nYou check the lock,  \\nYou reassure yourself that nothing's at the window.\\n\\nBut you're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering what that was.  \\nNothing's gonna happen.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nNothing's gonna happen.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nYou turn a key,  \\nYou flip a switch,  \\nYou settle back into the blissful unfamiliar.  \\nYou close your eyes,  \\nBut there's an itch,  \\nA little hurt your heart retrieves.  \\nBut you ignore  \\nThe tiny twitch,  \\nPretend the feeling will be gone before the morning.\\n\\nBut you're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering where you are.  \\nNothing's gonna happen.  \\n\\n> Robert & Francesca:  \\nNothing's gonna happen.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nBut wouldn't it be fine to share  \\nThe weather in her eyes, her hair,  \\nHer footsteps as she climbs the stair,  \\nThe shadow in her light?\\n\\nBut everything you know is true  \\nAnd everything you want to do  \\nAnd everything that makes you you  \\nCollides against the night.  \\nAnd nothing's black and white.\\n\\nAnd you're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering what to do.  \\nYou're wondering.  \\nYou're wondering.  \\nYour wondering if it's true.  \\nNothing's gonna happen.  \\nNothing has to happen.\\n\\n\\n## Scene 4: Roseman Bridge\\n\\nFrancesca: Mr. Kincaid? Mr. Kincaid... (He is behind her)\\n\\n> Robert: Right here.\\n\\nFrancesca: Oh, you scared me.\\n\\n> Robert: (As he shoots) I'm happy to see you. How did you know I'd still be here?\\n\\nFrancesca: (A moment) You're causing quite a commotion in the town.\\n\\n> Robert: Oh, I know. People been drivin' by all day taking pictures of the hippie taking pictures of the bridge.\\n\\nFrancesca: Did this ever happened before?\\n\\n> Robert: Everywhere I go. Like it's not right for a man to just be passing through. You'd think I'd be used to it. But I'm always suspect somehow. That time I went to Iceland, the lady wouldn't rent me a room because she said I was one of the Hidden People. Said her mother told her you should never go into a cave with a Hidden Person, so no room for me. (He waits, with his camera just below his eye.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Have you been working all day?\\n\\n> Robert: Not really. I've mainly been waiting.\\n\\nFrancesca: For what?\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nIt starts with the light.  \\nIt's like you wouldn't even know which way to look  \\nUntil the sun showed you a line,  \\nShowed you a corner,  \\nBuilt you a frame,  \\nThen you can see.\\n\\n(He walks to her, points at the bridge)\\n\\n(Spoken:) See?  \\n(Now he puts the camera in front of her)  \\n(Spoken:) Now: See?\\n\\nSee the world!  \\nHere's the world through a small, small window.  \\nYou thought it was bridge,  \\nYou thought it was the water,  \\nYou thought it was the sky...  \\nIt's the world, inside a frame.\\n\\nAnd you wait.  \\nAnd you wait.  \\nAnd you wait.  \\nAnd you...  \\nRight there, something shifted! Something...  \\nThat tree threw a shadow! Did you...?\\n\\n(Excited but controlled, he clicks the shutter)\\n\\nThere! There! There!  \\nIt's like all you didn't know that you were waiting for  \\nIs just outside the frame,  \\nAnd it can change  \\nThe way you see...\\n\\n(He lowers the camera)\\n\\nSee the world!  \\nHere's the world in a box forever.\\n\\n(He looks at Francesca. Sees something)\\n\\nGo stand over there.\\n\\n(She walks to where he's pointing. He raises the camera to his eye.)\\n\\nDon't look at me.  \\n-Now:  \\nLook at me.\\n\\n(She does. Electric.)\\n\\nLook at me.  \\nThere. There.  \\nThere. There.  \\nThere.\\n\\n(He continues taking pictures of her, and then the role is finished)\\n\\nThere's the world.  \\nThere's the world in your face, Francesca.\\n\\nDon't worry. This is not for them. This one is for me.\\n\\n(He puts the camera away, digs into his bag and pulls out the canteen.)\\n\\nOK. All done. Are you thirsty?\\n\\nFrancesca: So thirsty.\\n\\n(They sit on the bench. He offers her a drink from his canteen)\\n\\n> Robert: Here you go.\\n\\nFrancesca: (As she drinks) What happens after you take the pictures?\\n\\n> Robert: I'll drive into Des Moines tomorrow and send the rolls of film to New York. Then I'll wait around the Motor Court til they call me and say if I got what they want, or not. Then I'm off to New York to take pictures of the Hare Krishnas.\\n\\n(He brings out another package it is wrapped in brown paper)\\n\\nI brought you a present. I was going to leave it in your mailbox.\\n\\n(She gives him back the canteen and takes the package)\\n\\nFrancesca: What is it?\\n\\n> Robert: On my way out of Seattle, I picked up a big bag of mail. Last night I went through it and look what I found.\\n\\n(She opens the package. It's a magazine.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Is this what it looks like now?\\n\\n> Robert: The rest of it is on page 43. Naples Today. They said it was the most bombed city in the war. That's why they sent me there. To document the reconstruction.\\n\\n(When she arrives at the page, her eyes water suddenly.)\\n\\nI'm sorry. I thought it would make you happy.\\n\\n(She looks through the pages)\\n\\nFrancesca: It's all the places that were destroyed by the bombs. Only here, it's all back the way it was. This is where I went to the market with Mama. That's our church. And there's my... There's my bench.\\n\\n> Robert: I took that picture because it was the only thing that seemed to have survived intact.\\n\\nFrancesca: That bench at the Harbor is where I waited for my fiancé, Paolo to come back from the war.\\n\\n> Robert: But he didn't come home.\\n\\nFrancesca: No. (There is a moment. she turns more pages.) Oh look at it! I miss it so much. I didn't know how much. I ran away from home and now I can't get back. Please forgive me. Can I keep this?\\n\\n> Robert: I brought it for you.\\n\\nFrancesca: I will look at it again on a day when I'm not so... weepy. I'm sorry. Will you come to supper tonight?\\n\\n> Robert: Of course. I'll go back to the Motor Court and clean up and be there in about an hour.\\n\\nFrancesca: You can use my shower to clean up.\\n\\n> Robert: Okay then. I'll pack up and be right there.\\n\\nFrancesca: Robert, thank you for this.\\n\\n> Robert: This is what we hope for, that someday, one picture will make a difference to somebody.\\n\\n## Scene 5: The second evening at Francesca's house\\n\\n(They walk into the house Robert carrying the cooler)\\n\\nFrancesca: Shower is just down the hall there, and I'll take my bath upstairs.\\n\\n> Robert: Want a beer for your bath?\\n\\nFrancesca: Thank you. (She takes the beer in the phone rings. He heads for the shower.)\\n\\n----------\\n\\n### In the kitchen\\n\\n(Robert is finishing up cleaning a camera and she walks in. He looks up)\\n\\n> Robert: You are so beautiful.\\n\\n(She stands perfectly still. She doesn't move. He gets up to move toward her.) Do you know how beautiful you are? How did I get here?\\n\\nFrancesca: I invited you. (They look at each other for a long moment) Either that, or the patron saint of Iowa housewives sent you to me. Or my sister, Chiara. She would like this alright. I'm feeling like a boring housewife but you come along and I feel like myself again.\\n\\n(As she passes him, he raises his hand out to stroke her shoulder.)\\n\\n> Robert: Is it okay if I touch you?\\n\\nFrancesca: Is this what always happens when you come to a town? You meet a woman who opens up to you for some reason, she doesn't know why, and before she knows it, she's bought a new dress and invited you for dinner again and—\\n\\n(He stops)\\n\\n> Robert: No. I tried to leave yesterday. I tried not to eat supper here. You saw that.\\n\\n(She laughs a little and nods, and maybe reaches her hand up to touch his hand on her shoulder)\\n\\nNo, this isn't always what happens. I *never* let this happen. I never go into this world where people belong to each other.\\n\\n(Steps away a little)\\n\\nAs soon as I know I got the shots they need, I will be gone and on to the next job. So I know I can't stay anywhere, regardless of what happens. This is why...\\n\\n(Taking his time to remind her)\\n\\nI never walk in the house, I never drink the tea, I never stay for supper, I never come back the next night, I never get this close, I never touch your arm, I never do this.\\n\\n(He kisses her)\\n\\nFrancesca: I understand.\\n\\n> Robert: And you don't do this either.\\n\\nFrancesca: No. I don't.\\n\\n(They kiss again)\\n\\n> Robert: So if you're going to make me go to the Motor Court, do it now, OK. I think I could leave now if you wanted me to.\\n\\n(He kisses her again)\\n\\n(The phone rings. She starts not to answer it, but he motions to her to take it. She moves across the kitchen to the phone on the wall behind him)\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: Bye, Marge. Say hi to Charlie for me.\\n\\n(She hangs up the phone, gently separates from Robert and moves toward the sink. He walks to the radio.)\\n\\n> Robert: So you're coming with me to Des Moines tomorrow?\\n\\nFrancesca: If I'm invited.\\n\\n> Robert: You are. How would you feel about a little music?\\n\\nFrancesca: I'd like that. I don't know what stations have the music though. We only use the radio to listen for the weather and the price of corn.\\n\\n(He finds the station with no trouble at all. She seems very nervous. She should be cooking now, but she doesn't want to. He finds a big-band song.)\\n\\n> Robert: How's that?\\n\\nFrancesca: I like it. (She looks at the pasta on the counter) Would you like to have supper? I could have the pasta ready in a minute.\\n\\n> Robert: What I would like to do... is dance.\\n\\n(The music begins to come up over them, like a fog creeping in the door. They moved toward each other.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Okay.\\n\\n(He smiles, puts his beer on the counter and takes her hand.)\\n\\n----------\\n\\nMarge:  \\n'Cause I'm ready and I'm waiting  \\nDaddy, let me get closer to you.\\n\\n(Marge exits)\\n\\n(As the song finishes in music, Francesca and Robert are dancing very slowly, her head buried in his neck. She tilts her head up.)\\n\\n(They kiss.)\\n\\n(He kisses her again and another melody comes up under the radio tune)\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nWhat was I saying before about being lost?  \\nThe thing is, I knew where I was,  \\nBut not where I was going.  \\nWhy did I walk those mountains?  \\nWhy did I ride those ships?  \\nWhy did I watch those horses running wild?  \\nNow I know.  \\nNow I know.\\n\\nAll my life, I have been falling.  \\nI have been falling into you,  \\nFrancesca.  \\nCircling in the sky,  \\nLooking for a harbor  \\nComing into view.  \\nAll my life, I have been falling  \\nInto you.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nWhatever this is...  \\n...  \\nTo know this moment,  \\nTo cross this line.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAdding up all those minutes  \\nStaring through all I saw,  \\nHow could I know the answer  \\nWould it be you?\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nHow could I know the answer  \\nWill you be you?\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nOnly you.\\n\\n> Robert and Francesca:  \\nAll my life I have been falling.  \\nI have been falling into you,  \\nFrancesca.  \\nThis is where I land.  \\nYou are what I've looked for.  \\nNow is what it is true.  \\nAll my life,\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nI have been falling  \\nInto you.\\n\\n# Act 2\\n\\n### After State Fair song\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nMaybe you sleep so peaceful  \\nBecause you haven't got a worry in your head.  \\nMm.  \\nOr maybe you keep your eyes closed  \\nSo you never have to get out of this bed.  \\nMm.  \\nWell, you don't have to make the toast  \\nOr get the kids to school,  \\nSo rest your head and stay here close to me.  \\nThere's nothin' in this world today  \\nBut who we are and who we want to be.\\n\\nMaybe I'm being selfish.  \\nI should get my things and walk out of that door.  \\nMm.  \\nBut maybe we both deserve this.  \\nAnd besides, how could I keep from wanting more?  \\nMm.\\n\\nAnd lying here with curtains drawn,  \\nYour hair across my chest,  \\nI can't think what else I would need to see.  \\nThere's nothing in this world today  \\nBut who we are and who we want to be.\\n\\nCompany:  \\nOh, Oh, (Etc.)\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAnd maybe after all these years  \\nOf lookin' for a home,  \\nA woman in a farmhouse held the key.  \\nThere's nothing in this world today  \\nBut who we are and who we're meant to be.\\n\\nFrancesca: That clock must've stopped. It can't be 10 o'clock in the morning.\\n\\n> Robert: Is that a bad time to be in bed?\\n\\n(A moment. Then he leans down to kiss her and then starts to stretch over her, but she stops him)\\n\\nFrancesca: I need to get up.\\n\\n> Robert: OK.\\n\\n(She sits up in the bed little, then realizes she is naked.)\\n\\n(She looks around for a robot or something)\\n\\nThis is when we need to be in a hotel, so we can just call downstairs and order some breakfast.\\n\\nFrancesca: Coffee at least.\\n\\n> Robert: Coffee would be good. I can make you a cup. Should I go down and do that? Are you hungry?\\n\\nFrancesca: I might be. I don't know.\\n\\n> Robert: OK. I'll cook too. How's toast and eggs?\\n\\nFrancesca: No you shouldn't have to cook breakfast.\\n\\n> Robert: It's OK. I have to leave in a little while anyway, get my film to the post office in Des Moines.\\n\\nFrancesca: Robert.\\n\\n> Robert: Yes.\\n\\nFrancesca: Is what I felt with you... is that what other lovers feel all the time?\\n\\n> Robert: No. (A moment) It was you.\\n\\nFrancesca: Well. It was never me before.\\n\\n(He kisses her gently.)\\n\\n> Robert: Well. It's you now. And me. It's us now.\\n\\nFrancesca: (Falling into him) Oh Robert.\\n\\n> Robert: You still want to drive to Des Moines with me this morning? How far is it?\\n\\nFrancesca: Far enough.\\n\\n> Robert: Far enough so I can kiss you in the street without getting shot?\\n\\nFrancesca: I think so.\\n\\n> Robert: So why don't you get dressed and I'll make us a breakfast to go. I'll put the coffee in my thermos. Is there anything else you'd like me to do?\\n\\nFrancesca: (Beginning to loosen up) That you haven't done to me already?\\n\\n> Robert: I was thinking like milk the cow. Don't you farm people have chores?\\n\\nFrancesca: I forget if we have a cow.\\n\\n> Robert: (Making as if to leave) I'll go check.\\n\\nFrancesca: Stop\\n\\n(He laughs, and goes back to kiss her with fierce happiness)\\n\\nDon't stop.\\n\\n> Robert: (Falling back into the bed) I adore you.\\n\\n## Scene 2: The kitchen/Des Moines\\n\\n(They have coffee in the kitchen)\\n\\nFrancesca: You really did make the coffee.\\n\\n> Robert: I really did.\\n\\nFrancesca: People laugh at me about that coffee pot.\\n\\n> Robert: Well, after the coffee I had in town yesterday, I'm glad to see it.\\n\\nFrancesca: Bud thinks...\\n\\n> Robert: Do you take cream?\\n\\nFrancesca: No.\\n\\n> Robert: I knew that.\\n\\nFrancesca: How did you know that?\\n\\n> Robert: Well, I'm sure this cream is good...\\n\\nFrancesca: It is. It's especially good whipped on top of–\\n\\n> Robert: Pecan pie.\\n\\n> Robert and Francesca: Or peaches.\\n\\n> Robert: But the coffee is better black.\\n\\nFrancesca: This is good. Not everybody knows how to make a good cup of coffee.\\n\\n> Robert: The other day, you said... This life wasn't what you dreamed of as a girl.\\n\\nFrancesca: No it wasn't.\\n\\n(They drive to Des Moines)\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: (Ending the song:)  \\nFar enough that I could feel  \\nAlmost real.\\n\\n> Robert: And where is Chiara now?\\n\\nFrancesca: Still in Naples. With husband number four, I think. Still convinced I've wasted my life trying to be... perfect.\\n\\n> Robert: And have you been back to Italy at all?\\n\\nFrancesca: No. I'd love to go and take Carolyn and Michael. But it's money we don't have.\\n\\n> Robert: Still, you've been cooking for them, so that counts.\\n\\nFrancesca: And I sang to them in Italian when they were little.\\n\\n> Robert: I wish I was drinking your coffee.\\n\\nFrancesca: Here you go.\\n\\n(They laugh together about this)\\n\\nMichael should go to Italy. He should go somewhere. I'm worried that he's starting to hate everything here. Iowa is so flat, you feel like the only way out is to blast straight up like a rocket.\\n\\n> Robert: And you're worried what Michael might do to feel like he's \\\"out of Iowa.\\\"\\n\\nFrancesca: That's exactly what I'm afraid of.\\n\\n> Robert: And what does Bud think?\\n\\nFrancesca: But I won't tolerate her rebellion. I'm afraid he'll drive Michael away before he ... has a chance to leave on his own terms.\\n\\n> Robert: My father threw me out.\\n\\nFrancesca: So it could be a good thing, you mean. You turned out just fine.\\n\\n> Robert: I guess.\\n\\nFrancesca: What do you mean, you guess. Look at you.\\n\\n(The waitress brings them a check)\\n\\nWaitress: Can I bring you folks anything else?\\n\\n> Robert and Francesca: We're fine.\\n\\n## Scene 3 - The evening. Francesca's bedroom\\n\\nFrancesca: Ah!! I liked being out in the world with you today.\\n\\n> Robert: Well, I don't know if I call Des Moines \\\"the world,\\\" but I liked it too. Then again, I've never felt like this so I don't know what to call anything.\\n\\nFrancesca: Felt like what?\\n\\n> Robert: Dizzy. And happy. I don't feel like we are in Iowa. I feel like we've been picked up in a tornado and we're on our way to... (The phone rings)\\n\\n----------\\n\\nBud: Goodnight.\\n\\n(Robert feels something new from her but isn't sure what it is.)\\n\\n> Robert: Do you want me to go?\\n\\nFrancesca: No, please.\\n\\n----------\\n\\n-Torn in half:  \\nBefore and after you.\\n\\n> Robert: I love you, Francesca.\\n\\nFrancesca: And I love you. More than my own life, I love you.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nFor the first time in my life,  \\nI am not outside moment  \\nWith a camera in between me and the world  \\nI think I know.  \\nFor the first time in my life,  \\nI am somehow part of something.  \\nYou surround me, you connect to me,  \\nAnd I think I can't let go.  \\nFor the first time in my life,  \\nYou have opened up a channel  \\nThere is nothing to contain us,  \\nWe are joined, and we are free.  \\nFor the first time in my life,  \\nI am risking something precious.  \\nI am asking you, Francesca:  \\nCome with me.\\n\\nI can't tell you I know what the future will be.  \\nWho knows anything?  \\nI just look at those eyes; you've got so much to see.  \\nLet me show you. There's  \\nCrowds and camels and hillsides to climb.  \\nAll I know is, in all of the time  \\nFrom man's first breath  \\nTo God's last warning,  \\nYou and I are just one second,  \\nSpinning by in one split second.  \\nYou and I have just one second  \\nAnd a million miles to go.\\n\\nI don't need to be rich, I don't need something new.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nI don't want to go back to a world without this.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAll I need, all I've needed my whole life was you.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nIf I left this behind...\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nPlease just look at me  \\nYou were born with a wanderer's soul.  \\nThis is how you begin to be whole.  \\nThe stars keep burning,  \\nWorlds keep turning\\n\\n> Robert and Francesca:  \\nAnd you and I are just one second,  \\nSpinning by in just one second,  \\nYou and I have just one second\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAnd a million miles to go...\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nFound and lost.  \\nTorn in half.  \\nBefore and after you.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nCome with me.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nOpen-heart,  \\nOpen-door.  \\nBefore and after you.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nCome with me.\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nHow do I go?  \\nTell me.  \\nHow do I go?  \\nHow do I go with you?  \\nHow do I pack a bag,  \\nClose the door,  \\nTurn a key,  \\nWalk away?  \\nLook at where I am  \\nAnd who I am  \\nAnd tell me.  \\nIs there something I don't know?  \\nHow do I go?  \\nHow can I go  \\nWith you?\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nI can't tell you I know what the answer will be.  \\nIt's impossible.  \\nBut this thing, this is bigger than what we can see.  \\nThis is destiny.  \\nWe are tied, we are locked, we are bound;  \\nThis will not be reversed or unwound.  \\nWhatever fate the stars are weaving,  \\nWe're not breaking,  \\nI'm not leaving,  \\nAnd do you and I are just one second.  \\nSpinning by and just one second.  \\nYou and I have just one second...\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nAnd a million miles to go.\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAll my life I have been falling...\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nAll my life I have been falling...\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAll my life I have been falling into...\\n\\nFrancesca:  \\nAll my life I have been falling...\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nYou and I\\n\\n> Robert and Francesca:  \\nHave just one second\\n\\n> Robert:  \\nAnd a million miles to go.\\n\\n## Scene 4 - Friday morning\\n\\n(It is nearly noon. Robert jumps out of the bed.)\\n\\n> Robert: Oh my God, Francesca, it's almost noon.\\n\\nFrancesca: No. It can't be. They couldn't be here in an hour. It could be here in half an hour.\\n\\n> Robert: Do you know what time they were leaving?\\n\\n(She jumps out of bed, put a robe on and begins to strip the sheets off the bed.)\\n\\nFrancesca: Maybe Bud told me, but I wasn't listening. You have to leave. I have to change that. I have to clean the kitchen and get dressed and...\\n\\n> Robert: Francesca. It's at least an eight-hour drive from Indianapolis, so even if they left at seven, you've got at least three hours before they get here, maybe four.\\n\\nFrancesca: Robert. They can't find you here.\\n\\n> Robert: Listen, I'll be in town all afternoon. But if George has the pictures he needs, I'll have to leave for New York by six.\\n\\nFrancesca: But what if I can't get there by six?\\n\\n> Robert: Then I'll wire you the money to come to New York. Or call the magazine. They always know how to find me. You call me and I will come get you. All you have to do, ever, is call.\\n\\nFrancesca: If you carry me to the truck right now and force me to go with you, I would ago.\\n\\n> Robert: Is that what you want?\\n\\nFrancesca: No, I don't want to leave without seeing them. I'm afraid if I did, the guilt of knowing how I have hurt them would turned me into someone you wouldn't love it all.\\n\\n> Robert: No. Not possible.\\n\\nFrancesca: Don't leave me, Robert.\\n\\n> Robert: I'm not leaving you. I'm waiting for you. (He runs down the stairs and she follows)\\n\\nFrancesca: Robert!\\n\\n> Robert: Six o'clock.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: Oh Robert. I love you. Take me with you.\\n\\n> Robert: OK. Let's go.\\n\\n## Scene 5 - Years go by\\n\\n----------\\n\\nFrancesca: Johnson's. Is someone there?\\n\\n(Shift 10 years and then to Robert's office)\\n\\n(We hear the phone ringing again. The lights change, and we find Robert sitting at his desk, over a large trashcan, into which he is throwing his photos.)\\n\\nGinny: National Geographic.\\n\\n> Robert: Hi Ginny. It's Robert Kincaid. Can you get George for me?\\n\\nGinny: He's in Nepal, Mr. Kincaid. He called you 100 times to get you to go with him. Where have you been?\\n\\n> Robert: You don't want to know. But I'm home now.\\n\\nGinny: George said if you called, he wants you there as soon as you can get there.\\n\\n> Robert: I can't go anywhere, Ginny. I called to say I'm kind of closing up shop here.\\n\\nGinny: You can't do that. You're the best we've got.\\n\\n> Robert: I don't know about that, but I'm not taking any more pictures. My doctors are telling me... Do you still have that number?—the one I gave you after I did those pictures of the covered bridges?\\n\\nGinny: I have it, but she hasn't called. Do you still want me to tell her how to find you?\\n\\n> Robert: No, don't give her the number now. I can't–Ginny, thank you so much for helping me wait for her call. In case she needed me.\\n\\nGinny: Of course. It was my pleasure.\\n\\n> Robert: Got to go now.\\n\\nThere was something in the desert.  \\nThere was some place wild and green,  \\nAnd a child in a village I passed through.  \\nThere are places that I've traveled,  \\nAnd so many things I've seen,  \\nIt all fades away but you.\\n\\n(He drops a stack of negatives in the trashcan and sets them on fire. Then another pile of them as well. And a final stack of prints. As the song goes on, we may see the photographs he is discarding been projected on the screen.)\\n\\nI was sliding down a mountain,  \\nI was burning in the sun,  \\nI was crying with amazement at the view.  \\nI was capturing a moment,  \\nBut when all is said and done,  \\nWell, it all fades away but you.  \\nIt all fades away, it all fades away,  \\nIt all fades away but you.\\n\\n(Robert packs his cameras into a card box and closes it.)\\n\\nI have sailed across the oceans,  \\nPast the cities and the farms,  \\nOn a never-ending quest for something new,  \\nAnd the only things that mattered  \\nWere the four days in your arms,  \\n'Cause it all fades away but you.  \\nIt all fades away, it all fades away,  \\nIt all fades away but you.\\n\\n(As the mandolin plays, Robert sings along, holding one last photograph.

You’ve lived next door to me for the last two years.\\n\\n> Carol: (Laughing) Oh that’s funny Sam. You got me good with that one.\\n\\nSal: No it really is, I mean I really have… nevermind, it doesn’t matter. I was wondering, if you’re not too busy, if you might want to go have a drink.\\n\\n> Carol: I would love to.\\n\\nSal: Really?\\n\\n> Carol: Sure, that sounds great; I could really use one.\\n\\nSal: Where would you like to go?\\n\\n> Carol: Maybe to the Olive Garden. It’s a nice place, and the guys leave you alone there, on account of their embarrased to be seen at the Olive Garden, and usually they’re sipping on something large and fruity.\\n\\nSal: I don’t thinks that’s very politically…\\n\\n> Carol: What’s not politically?\\n\\nSal: I mean fruity is not a good way of describing something, it’s offencive to…\\n\\n> Carol: I meant like something that’s got pinapple or an orange in it.\\n\\nSal: Oh, I thought you were talking about…\\n\\n> Carol: You know, one of those gay drinks.\\n\\nSal: Oh, well… I mean that’s what I was talking about…\\n\\n> Carol: Don’t have to worry about a guy who’s drinking one of those hitting on you.\\n\\nSal: Don’t worry, I won’t let any guys hit on you.\\n\\n> Carol: How would you know if guys were hitting on me.\\n\\nSal: Because I’ll be sitting next to you or across from you, I mean I’ll be there with you, at the Olive Garden.\\n\\n> Carol: Why would you be at the Olive Garden?\\n\\nSal: Because you said you would like to go have a drink.\\n\\n> Carol: And I would.\\n\\nSal: Well that’s… because I would be sitting next to you while you have a drink.\\n\\n> Carol: You mean you were asking if I want to go have a drink with you? (she starts laughing histerically) What?! Oh Pam! You are so funny.\\n\\nSal: It wasn’t meant to be a joke. I was really…\\n\\n> Carol: You had me going fram. You should be on one of those prank shows, where they jump out of a bush and scare someone. (Screams like she is scaring him, he jumps) See. It’s funny.\\n\\nSal: (Hurt) That’s a good idea. Maybe I should make a video where I jump out of your bush.\\n\\n> Carol: what?\\n\\nSal: A bush! Not your bush, I mean I don’t even know if you have a bush, maybe it’s all slick down there. It’s not like I’ve been peeking in your bathroom window, I would never do that, so I have no idea about your down there, your down stairs area, where you keep your… vagina.\\n\\n> Carol: (Shocked)That is not appropriate Spam! How dare you talk about my bush like that! You’re not even old enough to be thinking about things like bushes or vaginas.

I’m going to read all this mail on the table right by the cradenza where I keep my Machete, for chopping stuff, then I’m going to get in my older car, the one with the messed up brakes, and drive on that mountainous road to get to the Olive Garden, and don’t even try to follow me!\\n\\nSal: What’s a cradenza?\\n\\n> Carol: I forget how young you are sometimes. A cradenza is like a cabinet with drawers and a couple of doors on the front. You can use it to store stuff, like weapons or machettes. Anyway, it doesn’t matter, because I will never show you my cradenza. You’ll never see it, not even if you beg.\\n\\nSal: Okay I’m not going to…\\n\\n> Carol: Just shut up! You can’t see it, so stop begging!\\n\\nSal: I’m not, I don’t even want to see it. Unless you really want to show it to me.\\n\\n> Carol: I don’t! Never!\\n\\nSal: Okay, well, I think I’m going to…\\n\\n> Carol: NEVER!\\n\\nSal: home now. Okay, okay, I promise not to ask again. I’m just going to go\\n\\n> Carol: Maybe you should. I mean, how could you think I would go to the Olive Garden with a kid like you? I am way too hot for you. Who do you think you are, Burt Reynolds.\\n\\nSal: Why does everyone keep talking about him?\\n\\n> Carol: Just go, and don’t ever come back.\\n\\nSal: But I live here.\\n\\n> Carol: Oh right. Okay, you can come back, but sneak in through the fire escape so I don’t have to look at your sickening face.\\n\\nSal: I don’t have a fire escape. How about the window?\\n\\n> Carol: I don’t give a shit how you do it, just be sneaky, like you would be if you were going to break into my apartment to sniff my panties or to seek revenge for me spurning you; rummaging through my cradenza looking for the machete I keep in the top drawer; or maybe cutting my break line to my crappy car so I would drive off the side of that mountain on the way to the Olive Garden, where everyone is like family, a big Italian family, but you don’t have to be actual family, and there’s no actual Italians, so it’s mainly Irish immagrants, while taking into account that everyone at the Olive Garden knows me, and know’s my breaks are shitty, because they grind when I press on them and everyone in the parkinglot can hear it. That’s how sneaky I want you to be.\\n\\nSal: Wow, that is super specific.\\n\\n> Carol: What does spalsilfic mean?\\n\\nSal: I’m not sure what you’re saying.\\n\\n> Carol: Spasilfic, that word you just said.\\n\\nSal: Spa-cific?\\n\\n> Carol: Yes, that one, college boy.\\n\\nSal: it means…\\n\\n> Carol: Just shut the fuck up flap!

You’ve delivered your non- message – thank you very much. Go and discuss press relations with my agent.\\n\\n(THEY ALL LEAVE RELUCTANTLY.

I didn’t.\\n\\nGrace: No, I don’t think you did, but everyone else seems to think you did – so what’s it all about?\\n\\n> Jimmy: I, er.... It’s rather hard to explain.\\n\\nGrace: Then let me take a guess.  I know exactly who you are.\\n\\n> Jimmy: (APPREHENSIVE) You do?\\nGrace: You’re the paparazzi.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Paparazzi?\\n\\nGrace: Think I can’t recognise a hack when I see one? I’ve had to put up with you lot dogging me all my life.  Didn’t follow all the others to the Carlton, but came here instead, didn’t you?  Well?\\n\\n> Jimmy: (SEEING A GLIMMER OF HOPE) Er.... that’s right.\\n\\nGrace: After a cheap story, aren’t you?  Sensational Cannes Festival scoop.  What a nerve!  How did you get into my suite?\\n\\n> Jimmy: I, er.... the door was unlocked.\\n\\nGrace: Was it indeed? Interesting. So you thought you’d just wander in and sniff around, eh? Thought you might have yourself an exclusive.\\n\\n> Jimmy: (APOLOGETIC)  That’s right.  I....\\n\\nGrace: Well you certainly stumbled on one, didn’t you? Discovered a star’s dead body on the sofa. Scoop of the year! Except I wasn’t quite dead.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Yes. I....\\n\\nGrace: Then what happened? Everyone arrived and you were caught with your pants down?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well not exactly....\\n\\nGrace: And my leading man mistook you for my husband.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Yes.

There’s a big difference.\\n\\n> Jimmy: (BEWILDERED)  Right.  So why did he....?\\n\\nGrace: Not admit to being my husband? That’s what I want to find out. Did he in fact try to poison me? Has he got a mistress? Is it that bimbo who just arrived?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Oh, I don’t think so.\\n\\nGrace: How would you know?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well she.... I mean.... she doesn’t look the sort.\\n\\nGrace: On the contrary, she looks exactly the sort.\\n\\n> Jimmy: No, no....\\n\\nGrace: Why are you defending her?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well, I just... I....\\n\\nGrace: One hell of a headline you’ve got unravelling here, haven’t you, chum? Which rag do you work for?\\n\\n> Jimmy: I, er.... I’m freelance.\\n\\nGrace: Well I’ll tell you what, Mr er.... What’s your name?\\n\\n> Jimmy: J... just call me Jimmy.\\n\\nGrace: Right, Jimmy. Here’s the deal. You use your journalistic skills – otherwise known as nose for dirt – to find out what my husband is up to, and I’ll refrain from having you prosecuted for breaking and entering, invasion of privacy, attempted murder, and whatever else my lawyers can think of. How does that sound?\\n\\n> Jimmy: How do I do that? \\n\\nGrace: How do you usually do it? You people must glean at least a faint semblance of fact on which you base your fairy stories. Snoop around. Dig up the dirt. Sniff out the scandal. BUT... you bring it to me before you give it to any of the papers. Understood?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Right.\\n\\nGrace: (PACING) Meanwhile I have to think how I’m going to play things from now on. If my husband did try to poison me....\\n\\n> Jimmy: Why would he do that?  A wonderful woman like you.\\n\\nGrace: Oh thank you. Well he doesn’t think I’m such a wonderful woman.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Why not?\\n\\nGrace: Familiarity breeds contempt – both ways.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Oh.\\n\\nGrace: He also knows I’m worth a lot of money, which currently all goes to him on my demise.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Ah.\\n\\nGrace: He also knows I’m allergic to peanuts.  He also, I suspect, has a mistress who he’d very much like to shack up with.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Oh dear...\\n\\nGrace: And that piece of hot totty posing as a secretary is a very likely candidate.\\n\\n> Jimmy: No, no – I don’t think it’s her.\\n\\nGrace: What do you know about such things? You look as if you’ve just learnt about the birds and the bees.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well, I... Is that why he came back to the hotel? In case the press discovered you were dead?\\n\\nGrace: Possibly. Or to catch me with my lover.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Ah. Yes, he told me he thought you had a lover.\\n\\nGrace: Did he indeed? The pot calling the kettle black.\\n\\n> Jimmy: So that actor guy isn’t?\\n\\nGrace: Isn’t what?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Your lover.\\n\\nGrace: Of course he is.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Eh?\\n\\nGrace: Actresses always have affairs with their leading men.  It’s obligatory.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Wow. You show biz people!\\n\\nGrace: Don’t be silly. We’re no worse than anyone else. We just make more of a song and dance about it. Now – our problem is, how to explain your presence here, and how to get you access to my husband’s affairs without giving away what you’re up to.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Ah.\\n\\nGrace: If he finds out you’re a cheap hack he’ll have you for dinner.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Oh God.\\n\\nGrace: I know!\\n\\n> Jimmy: What?\\n\\nGrace: We’ll say the film company has taken you on to handle my publicity during the festival, and he has to find room for you in his production office. Perfect!\\n\\n> Jimmy: Publicity?\\n\\nGrace: It explains why you’re here, and you’ll be able to snoop around without anyone suspecting.\\n\\n> Jimmy: I don’t know anything about publicity.\\n\\nGrace: You know about newspapers, don’t you? Pretend to make some phone calls. Chat to your friends on the magazines. He’ll be glad to have you.\\n\\n> Jimmy: I don’t really think....\\n\\nGrace: Listen, sonny, you don’t have any choice in the matter. If you want to stay out of the clutches of the French police you’ll do what I want.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well....\\n\\nGrace: And if you find out what my other half’s really up to then I’ll give you the scoop of your life. ‘Grace Gervaise’s husband arrested for attempted murder, fraud, bigamy, assault, and whatever else we can think of!\\n\\n> Jimmy: Has he done all those things?\\n\\nGrace: Who knows?  That arsehole’s capable of anything.\\n\\n> Jimmy: I don’t understand how he could treat you like that.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nOscar: You see! Resorting to toy-boys now!\\n\\n(MARCHES TO JIMMY AND KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH A PUNCH.) \\n\\n> Jimmy: (JIMMY COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AGAIN)\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: What – you mean apart from being my lover who’s pretending to be my husband, who was trying to murder me?\\n\\nOscar: Oh, for God’s sake....!\\n\\n> Jimmy: (JIMMY GROANS AND WAKES UP)\\n\\nGrace: Poor Jimmy – are you all right?\\n\\nAdam: Well who is he?\\n\\nOscar: Yes, who is he?\\n\\nGrace: If you really want to know, he’s....\\n\\nOscar: No!

Well?\\n\\n> Jimmy: (JIMMY LOOKS AT GRACE, WHO SIGNALS FOR HIM TO SPEAK) I’m, er... I’m her new publicity agent.\\n\\nGrace: That’s right.\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\nGrace: The production company assigned him to look after me.\\n\\nOscar: A bit late. What’s he doing here?\\n\\n> Jimmy: I, er... came to talk to her.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: I took it out earlier because I was going to wear it. My necklace – given me by Prince Abdul. It’s gone! It’s... we’ve... someone’s taken it!\\n\\n(SHE GLARES ROUND THE ROOM)\\n\\nWho?\\n\\n(PAUSE.  EVERYONE IS FROZEN)\\n\\nIt must be somebody here.\\n\\nAdam: It could have been the staff.\\n\\nGrace: None of the staff have been in since lunch time.\\n\\n> Jimmy: (JIMMY SURREPTITIOUSLY TAKES THE NECKLACE FROM HIS POCKET AND DROPS IT INTO A WASTE BIN. GRACE HEARS THE SOUND AND TURNS. HE GAZES BACK AT HER INNOCENTLY)\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nHailey: I wasn’t here then!\\n\\nGrace: Or my new publicity agent, who nobody knows anything about either, who’s in here nobody knows quite why, and who’s been in here nobody knows how long.\\n\\n> Jimmy: It wasn’t me.\\n\\nGrace: I don’t give a damn what Shakespeare wrote!

That’s outrageous!\\n\\nGrace: Fell for it though, didn’t you, Mr Randy?\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\nGrace: She swanned in all tits and thighs, and you thought Christmas had come!  Bet you didn’t even ask for her credentials.\\n\\n> Jimmy: She has a degree in economics actually.\\n\\nGrace: Really?\\n\\nHailey: Honours degree.\\n\\nGrace: Goodness! Sex and statistics all in one package. (TO OSCAR) Lucky old you.\\n\\nOscar: Oh shut up!\\n\\nBoniface: So – your wife took a position with Monsieur Gervaise, so was able to inform you when Madame Gervaise was alone in the hotel, so you could invade her rooms and discover a celebrity story.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Er... something like that.\\n\\nBoniface: And perhaps steal celebrity sparklers also?\\n\\n> Jimmy: No!\\n\\nBoniface: (HOLDING UP THE BALACLAVA)  Is this balaclava hat yours?\\n\\n> Jimmy: No - never seen it before.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nAdam: On his phone.

SOME CONFUSION OVER GLASSES AS EVERYONE IS INVOLVED)\\n\\nBoniface: Success after all the dramas, all the crises.

Who knows?\\n\\n> Jimmy: No!\\n\\nBoniface: What?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Why would he...? I mean, what would he...?  I mean, why would he try to murder someone before stealing their jewellery?\\n\\nHailey: That’s a good point.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Madame, monsieur! This is not the way for imminent show business people to behave. Especially in front of the press.\\n\\n> Jimmy: No, quite.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: (POINTING AT OSCAR) You! You were handing out the glasses.\\n\\nOscar: No!  (POINTING AT JIMMY)  Him!  He was helping.\\n\\n> Jimmy: No, no, not me!\\n\\nBoniface: We cannot leave him on the floor.

Two celebrity murders to write about.\\n\\nBoniface: But Madame, what were you thinking?\\n\\nGrace: He deserved it. He had it coming. He poisoned my leading man – out of pure jealousy!\\n\\n> Jimmy: You don’t know it was him.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Uh! Such theatrics. (WIPES HIS BROW) I don’t know if I’m going or coming. My head is spinning. (WAVES AT THE PHONE) Someone please tell reception to stop the doctor coming.

ON THE WAY SHE SIGNALS TO JIMMY AND POINTS AT THE NECKLACE ON THE TABLE WHERE GRACE HAS LEFT IT)\\n\\nBoniface: (APOLOGETIC) I did not say because I was still trying to solve the rest of the mystery.

But it’s all right.\\n\\nHailey: (WEAK VOICE)  So many murders... and guns.... and poisons....\\n\\n> Jimmy: Yes, but nobody’s died.  We’re all here. Everything’s all right.\\n\\nHailey: You promise?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Yes, yes.\\n\\nOscar: This is beyond a joke!\\n\\nAdam: Hear, hear.\\n\\nBoniface: I agree, monsieur.

How?\\n\\nHailey: I was unconscious.\\n\\n> Jimmy: I was attending to her.\\n\\nBoniface: (SHRUGGING) They are so clever these Riviera thieves. They have such tricks. Maybe this time they somehow.... What do you think, Mr Paparazzi man?\\n\\n> Jimmy: It’s a mystery.  What do you think, Hailey?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: (OFFHAND)  It doesn’t really matter.  It wasn’t worth anything anyway.\\n\\nOscar: What do you mean?\\n\\nGrace: It wasn’t the real necklace.  It was a replica.\\n\\n> Jimmy: What?\\n\\nHailey: What?\\n\\nGrace: I never wear the real thing – it’s too valuable.\\n\\nBoniface: It wasn’t...!  Where is the real one?\\n\\nGrace: In your hotel safe, Monsieur Boniface.  Where I trust it’s really safe.  Unless your chef has access to it.\\n\\n> Jimmy: (GASPS OF INCREDULITY ALL ROUND. JIMMY AND HAILEY ROLL EYES AT EACH OTHER)\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nAdam: (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) All right.

The paparazzi man and his totty.\\n\\nHailey: Uh!\\n\\nAdam: (TO JIMMY) Well? What were your movements?\\n\\n> Jimmy: (INDICATING OSCAR) Well, the same as his. We helped carry you in there. We didn’t come back until the shots.\\n\\nGrace: Ah, but then what?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Well, we.... we....\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: I think little Jimmy and his pretty partner can tell us.\\n\\n(EVERYONE STARES AT THE PAIR)\\n\\nBoniface: Eh?\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\n> Jimmy: Us?\\n\\nGrace: Yes, you, you pseudo paparazzi man. You clever pair of innocents. You’re no journalist. She’s no secretary. You’re the Riviera jewel thieves, aren’t you?\\n\\nHailey: Us?\\n\\nGrace: You think you can pull the wool over my eyes? Me, the expert on every convoluted film plot ever written? The star of half the crime melodramas ever made? I rumbled you two the moment you met here.\\n\\nBoniface: Is this true?  You are the Riviera jewel thieves?\\n\\n> Jimmy: (BASHFUL) Well.... I suppose there’s no point in denying it now.\\n\\nOscar: Good God!\\n\\nAdam: Bloody hell!\\n\\nGrace: Leaving my necklace in the waste bin – really!\\n\\n> Jimmy: (SHRUGGING)  There was nowhere else.\\n\\nGrace: (TO HAILEY) That pathetic stage faint – huh!\\n\\nHailey: It fooled all of them.\\n\\nGrace: I’ve seen better ones in a Punch and Judy show. Tell me, are you two actually married?\\n\\nHailey: No.\\n\\n> Jimmy: We’re just partners.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: (TO THEM)  Replaced it after I told you it wasn’t worth anything, didn’t you?\\n\\n(THEY SHRUG)\\n\\nVery neat.  However, a big mistake.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Why?\\n\\nGrace: I was lying. It is in fact the real one.\\n\\nHailey: What??\\n\\nGrace: I decided I wanted the real thing for the premiere tonight, so I asked the receptionist to take it from the hotel safe this morning and leave the fake one in its place.\\n\\n> Jimmy: Uh...\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nAdam: (CLAPPING) Hurrah!

I was just....\\n\\n> Adam: What? What?\\n\\nJimmy: Trying to save her.\\n\\n> Adam: Don't give me that! She phoned me on the point of collapse. You were trying to poison her with crushed peanuts or peanut oil, or.... (POINTS AT THE TRAY) The forensics will find it and you'll be hung, drawn and quartered!\\n\\nOscar: You seem very concerned for someone who's just a fellow actor.\\n\\n> Adam: Of course!

Something odd is going on here....\\n\\nOscar: You'd better keep quiet, you.\\n\\nGrace: He's every right to speak.\\n\\nOscar: What – as both your leading man and stand-in at the same time, eh?\\n\\nGrace: He's nothing of the sort, and it's nothing to do with my agent anyway.\\n\\nOscar: (CONTAINING HIMSELF)  Grrrr!\\n\\nGrace: If you want to remain my agent you'd better stay out of this.\\n\\n> Adam: Yes, quite.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nHailey: I put them off the trail.

(INDICATES ADAM) This one, yes?\\n\\nGrace: Yes.\\n\\nBoniface: Please monsieur.\\n\\n> Adam: (RELUCTANTLY)  I object to this.\\n(EMPTIES HIS POCKETS)\\n\\nBoniface: Wallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....\\n\\nOscar: Hah!\\n\\nBoniface: ....packet of unmentionables. Small size.\\n\\nOscar: (TO GRACE)  Now who's the pot calling the kettle black?\\n\\nGrace: Nothing to do with me.\\n\\nOscar: (THREATENING ADAM)  Well I can't think what else they're for.\\n\\n> Adam: Emergencies – just like you.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Please, monsieur.  I will decide who is likely. (TO JIMMY)  Monsieur.\\n\\nJimmy: (JIMMY EMPTIES HIS POCKETS)\\n\\nBoniface: Wallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....\\n\\n> All: Aha!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Perhaps.  So now we try the actor's. (PRESSES BUTTONS.  GRACE'S PHONE ON THE DESK BUZZES) Aha!  Madame's phone, yes?\\n\\nOscar: I knew it! He's her lover!\\n\\n> Adam: Nonsense! I was....\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\n> Adam: Trying to call her back after she passed out.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Whose is this?  (LOOKS AT JIMMY)  Yours monsieur.\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\n> Adam: His?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: So – your wife took a position with Monsieur Gervaise, so was able to inform you when Madame Gervaise was alone in the hotel, so you could invade her rooms and discover a celebrity story.\\n\\nJimmy: Er... something like that.\\n\\nBoniface: And perhaps steal celebrity sparklers also?\\n\\nJimmy: No!\\n\\nBoniface: (HOLDING UP THE BALACLAVA)  Is this balaclava hat yours?\\n\\nJimmy: No - never seen it before.\\n\\n> Adam: Just a minute!\\n\\nBoniface: What?\\n\\n> Adam: (TO HAILEY) What's your name?\\n\\nHailey: Hailey.\\n\\n> Adam: Aha! H! The message was from you.\\n\\nBoniface: What message?\\n\\n> Adam: On his phone.  It came through just after I caught him.  'Don't do it.  Leave now.'\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nJimmy: I, er... didn't want anyone to know I was a journalist.\\n\\nOscar: Because.... (INDICATING ADAM) I found him here, and he didn't know I was her husband, and I wanted to find out what he was doing here.\\n\\n> Adam: Oh, really?\\n\\nOscar: Yes, really.\\n\\n> Adam: Grrrr!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: (PROCLAIMING) And finally - when everybody got here to the hotel, which one arrived wearing a balaclava hat, in time to put poison in Madame Gervaise's Caesar Salad??\\n\\nGrace: Yes. Who?\\n\\n> All: (EVERYONE LOOKS AT EVERYONE ELSE)\\n\\nBoniface: Of course the answer is...\\n\\nGrace: What?\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\n> Adam: What?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Yes, that's everyone.  And peanuts are easy to acquire.\\n\\nGrace: From your bar!\\n\\nBoniface: From anyone's bar. (TO ADAM) Yours for instance.\\n\\n> Adam: Ridiculous!\\n\\nBoniface: Why?\\n\\n> Adam: I'm her l... leading man. I'm completely innocent.\\n\\nBoniface: Nobody is innocent, monsieur, until I have found them not guilty.\\n\\n> Adam: You aren't the law here, Monsieur Boniface.  We should have called the police – I said so in the first place.\\n\\nBoniface: We do not need the police until I, Hercule Poirot of the Riviera, have discovered the culprits.  Then we will decide how to handle the situation. Now – Madame Gervaise.\\n\\nGrace: Yes?\\n\\nBoniface: What time did your husband leave this morning for his office?\\n\\nGrace: About nine oclock.\\n\\nBoniface: Too early to put peanuts in your salad.\\n\\n> Adam: Unless he nipped back later in his balaclava.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Monsieur actor.\\n\\n> Adam: Yes?\\n\\nBoniface: Where were you this morning before you got the call for help from Madame Gervaise?\\n\\n> Adam: At my hotel – eating peanuts.\\n\\nBoniface: Why aren't you staying at this hotel?\\n\\n> Adam: Because that's a better hotel.\\n\\nBoniface: (INDIGNANT)  There is no better hotel in Cannes than this hotel!\\n\\nOscar: I'll tell you why. Because it would be too obvious he was having an affair with my wife if he stayed at the same hotel.\\n\\nBoniface: Is this true?\\n\\n> Adam: Certainly not!\\n\\nBoniface: But you could have come to this hotel earlier, with your peanuts, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned Madame Gervaise's salad, and stolen her necklace at the same time.\\n\\n> Adam: That's nonsense!  If I'm having an affiar with her, why would I want to poison her?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Either one of these monsieurs, or madame bimbo, entered the apartment earlier by the balcony, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned madame's lunch when she was in the bedroom, stole her necklace, and left again.\\n\\n> Adam: Left again?\\n\\nBoniface: With the necklace, because it's not here. And then – this is the clever part - returned later to prove innocence. Voila the scenario!\\n\\nOscar: Then why would they leave the balaclava?\\n\\nBoniface: (DEFLATED) Ah. (BRIGHTENS) They forgot to take it with them – proving they are an amateur. Which is all of you – amateurs!\\n\\n> Adam: It doesn't make sense.\\n\\nBoniface: Why not?\\n\\n> Adam: Why would any one of us wish to poison a big film star like Grace, on the day of her premiere, and steal her jewellery at the same time, knowing that the whole world would then be on their tail?\\n\\n# Act 2\\n\\n(THE SAME, LATE THAT EVENING.

What do they know?\\n\\n(HAILEY IS SIGNALLING QUESTIONS TO JIMMY. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND GESTURES HOPELESSLY. HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND A SOFA CUSHION.

Nothing is going to spoil its glory.\\n\\n> Adam: Nothing!\\n\\nOscar: Aren't you forgetting something?\\n\\nGrace: What?\\n\\nOscar: A certain missing necklace.\\n\\n49\\n(DEFLATING)  Oh yes.\\n\\n> Adam: Oh yes, that.\\n\\nGrace: Why did you remind me? My beautiful necklace!\\n\\nJimmy: You, er... still haven't found it?\\n\\nGrace: Of course I haven't, silly boy. I'd be wearing it, wouldn't I? (THEATRICAL) The prince will never forgive me! (WEEPS) It's a tragedy!\\n\\n> Adam: There now, Grace, it'll turn up.\\n\\nGrace: How?  Where?  It's gone for ever!  The thing I loved most in the whole world!\\n\\nOscar: Oh, thanks very much.\\n\\nGrace: It was worth ten of you, you bimbo bonker!\\n\\nHailey: Ohhh!\\n\\nOscar: That's rich coming from you – gigolo juggler!\\n\\n> Adam: Hey!\\n\\nGrace: Hot totty tippler!\\n\\nOscar: Smarmy stud smoocher!\\n\\nGrace: You're drunk!\\n\\nOscar: So are you!\\n\\nGrace: I hate you!\\n\\nOscar: I despise you!\\n\\nHailey: Hey – stop it!\\n\\n> Adam: Cut it out!

I bring you champagne myself to celebrate. Courtesy of the Hotel Superb.\\n\\nOscar: Well thank you!\\n\\n> Adam: Wonderful!\\n\\n(BONIFACE BRINGS THE CHAMPAGNE TO THE SIDE TABLE)\\n\\nBoniface: All of Cannes is talking about it.

Perhaps he was here when I was murdered!\\n\\nOscar: Almost murdered.\\n\\n> Adam: Perhaps he was the murderer.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Perhaps for distraction.  Perhaps to make way for the theft.  Who knows?  They say these people are extremely ruthless.\\n\\nOscar: My god!\\n\\n> Adam: That's terrible.\\n\\nBoniface: However – everyone here is still a suspect until the true suspects are proved guilty and the false suspects are proved innocent!\\n\\nOscar: Fatuous!\\n\\n> Adam: Preposterous!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Madame, monsieur! This is not the way for imminent show business people to behave. Especially in front of the press.\\n\\nJimmy: No, quite.\\n\\nGrace: Well it's time the press exposed my sham of a husband.\\n\\nOscar: And my mockery of a wife.\\n\\nBoniface: Please, please – these are not the kinds of stories we want in the papers. (TO ADAM) You agree, monsieur?\\n\\n> Adam: Absolutely.  A little discretion, please!\\n\\nOscar: You keep out of this! It's none of your business, you ham actor!\\n\\n> Adam: Ham actor!  How dare you, you... you....\\n\\n(AT THAT MOMENT HE GRABS HIS THROAT AND EMITS A TERRIBLE CHOKING SOUND)\\n\\nBoniface: Monsieur?  What is the matter?\\n\\n> Adam: I... I'm....\\n\\n(COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AND CONVULSES.)\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: Oh, this is a calamity!  This is a cataclysm! (ALMOST WEEPING)  My hotel will be ruined!  Nobody will ever wish to stay here again!\\n\\nGrace: Nonsense, Monsieur Boniface - they'll all flock to see the scene of the crime. You'll be famous!\\n\\n> Adam: (AT THAT MOMENT ADAM APPEARS SHAKILY IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY) Hello everyone.  What's going on?\\n\\nBoniface: (STUNNED)  Monsieur!!\\n\\nGrace: Adam!  My lover!\\n\\n> Adam: I heard bangs.\\n\\nGrace: (RUSHING TO HIM) You're alive!\\n\\n> Adam: Of course I'm alive.\\n\\nBoniface: But you were poisoned, monsieur!\\n\\n> Adam: Rubbish. I just had an attack. I'm an epileptic. It happens sometimes when I'm stressed.\\n\\nOscar: An eciplect... a plecipept... ?\\n\\n> Adam: It knocks me out for a few moments, that's all. Nothing too serious.\\n\\nGrace: Oh, thank heavens! I thought I'd lost you.\\n\\n> Adam: 'Fraid not, old girl. Still here to do your next film.\\n\\nBoniface: But this is insane! She has killed her husband!\\n\\n> Adam: What?\\n\\nBoniface: She thought he had poisoned you.\\n\\n> Adam: (STARING AT OSCAR'S BODY) You killed Oscar?\\n\\nBoniface: She shot him.  In front of me.  In front of the paparazzi!\\n\\n> Adam: Oh my God, Grace!  You shot him?  What have you done??\\n\\nBoniface: It is the end of everything!\\n\\n> Adam: You'll go to prison for life!\\n\\nGrace: (CALMLY) Oh stop making such a drama of it. He's all right.\\n\\n> Adam: What?\\n\\nBoniface: What?\\n\\nGrace: (HOLDING UP THE GUN) It's the prop gun from the film. It only fires blanks. (TO OSCAR) Get up, you pansy! There's nothing wrong with you!\\n\\nOscar: (OSCAR STIRS AND SITS UP. EVERYONE GASPS) Oh well, that was quite fun, wasn't it?\\n\\n> Adam: What the...?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nHailey: (EVERYONE TURNS TO LOOK. SHE PASSES OUT ON THE FLOOR. THEY RUSH TO HER)\\n\\nBoniface: No, no, no! Not another one!\\n\\nGrace: Oh, the poor bimbo! What's the matter with her?\\n\\nOscar: She can't be epileptic too.\\n\\n> Adam: She's been poisoned!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nJimmy: Yes, but nobody's died.  We're all here. Everything's all right.\\n\\nHailey: You promise?\\n\\nJimmy: Yes, yes.\\n\\nOscar: This is beyond a joke!\\n\\n> Adam: Hear, hear.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: So much so that he gives you priceless necklaces and holidays on his yacht.  What else does he love about you, eh?\\n\\nGrace: My vital measurements too of course.\\n\\nOscar: Hah!\\n\\n> Adam: Oh for heaven's sake you two, cut it out!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: I put it here I tell you! I was going to put it in its case, and then Adam distracted everyone. (TO ADAM) This is your fault!\\n\\n> Adam: Oh please!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: (RESIGNED)  Search the room everyone!\\n\\n> All: (THEY ALL SEARCH THE ROOM, JIMMY AND HAILEY PRETENDING TO JOIN IN)\\n\\nGrace: The doors are all closed. No-one has left. It has to be here!\\n\\nOscar: It isn't.\\n\\n> Adam: Nothing.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nBoniface: (COLLAPSING ONTO THE SOFA)  I think I am imagining this whole day.  I think it is a reverie from which I will soon awake. (DISCOVERS THE BALACLAVA) Wait a minute. What is this? Another balaclava! (HOLDS IT UP)\\n\\n> Adam: It's the same one.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nOscar: There now, Grace, calm down. It's only jewellery.\\n\\nGrace: Only jewellery! It's the most beautiful thing I ever owned!\\n\\n> Adam: It'll turn up. We all saw it and nobody's gone out. It can't have gone far, can it Monsieur Boniface?\\n\\nBoniface: (SHRUGGING) They are so clever these Riviera thieves. They have such tricks. Maybe this time they somehow.... What do you think, Mr Paparazzi man?\\n\\nJimmy: It's a mystery.  What do you think, Hailey?\\n\\nHailey: It's incredible.  They've really got away with it!\\n\\nBoniface: What can I say?  Even I am bimboozled.\\n\\nGrace: (RECOVERING)  Oh well - easy come, easy go.\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\n> Adam: What are you saying?\\n\\nGrace: (OFFHAND)  It doesn't really matter.  It wasn't worth anything anyway.\\n\\nOscar: What do you mean?\\n\\nGrace: It wasn't the real necklace.  It was a replica.\\n\\nJimmy: What?\\n\\nHailey: What?\\n\\nGrace: I never wear the real thing – it's too valuable.\\n\\nBoniface: It wasn't...!  Where is the real one?\\n\\nGrace: In your hotel safe, Monsieur Boniface.  Where I trust it's really safe.  Unless your chef has access to it.\\n\\n> All: (GASPS OF INCREDULITY ALL ROUND. JIMMY AND HAILEY ROLL EYES AT EACH OTHER)\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: Don't be such a defeatist, Monsieur Poirot of the Riviera. This cannot be insoluble. Adam, I put you in charge of investigations. Retrace everyone's movements second by second from the time you collapsed.\\n\\n> Adam: Why me?\\n\\nGrace: Because you're the only one who couldn't have taken it. You were unconscious.\\n\\nOscar: No! He woke up before the theft was discovered.\\n\\nGrace: So what? He was half ga-ga.\\n\\nOscar: A clever ploy.\\n\\nGrace: Don't be silly. Adam, carry on.\\n\\n> Adam: (RESIGNED)  Very well, if you say so.\\n\\nGrace: Start with my husband.\\n\\nOscar: Ludicrous!  I steal my own wife's imitation jewels?\\n\\nGrace: You didn't know they were imitation. I never told you because I never trusted you.\\n\\nOscar: Oh, thank you very much. That's....\\n\\nGrace: Silence!  Adam.\\n\\n> Adam: (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) All right. Oscar, tell the company what you did when I collapsed?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: I wasn't pissed.\\n\\nOscar: You're still pissed now.\\n\\nGrace: Nonsense - I'm perfectly sober.\\n\\nOscar: You're never sober.  You don't know what sober means.  You....\\n\\n> Adam: Quiet!! Or I'll murder you both myself! (THEY RETREAT) Anyway, I don't see how he can have done it. He was on the floor half the time.\\n\\nGrace: All right, we'll come back to him.  What about Monsieur Boniface?\\n\\nBoniface: Me??\\n\\nGrace: When I went into the bedroom you were left alone in here with the necklace.\\n\\nBoniface: (SIGHING) Ah mon dieu! Now I am a jewel thief.\\n\\n> Adam: Well we never actually searched you, did we Monsieur Boniface?\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: All right. Now the paparazzi man and his bimbo.\\n\\nHailey: Ohh!\\n\\nJimmy: Please stop calling my wife a bimbo.\\n\\nGrace: Sorry. The paparazzi man and his totty.\\n\\nHailey: Uh!\\n\\n> Adam: (TO JIMMY) Well? What were your movements?\\n\\nJimmy: (INDICATING OSCAR) Well, the same as his. We helped carry you in there. We didn't come back until the shots.\\n\\nGrace: Ah, but then what?\\n\\nJimmy: Well, we.... we....\\n\\nHailey: We watched him (ADAM) come back from the dead, and then we watched him (OSCAR) come back from the dead, and then we watched her and him (GRACE AND OSCAR) continue to try and kill each other, and then I fainted, and then we watched Monsieur Boniface quietly losing his mind.\\n\\nBoniface: Yes, thank you.  I haven't found it yet.\\n\\n> Adam: (TO GRACE) Well that hasn't proved anything. We're still no closer.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: I think little Jimmy and his pretty partner can tell us.\\n\\n(EVERYONE STARES AT THE PAIR)\\n\\nBoniface: Eh?\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\nJimmy: Us?\\n\\nGrace: Yes, you, you pseudo paparazzi man. You clever pair of innocents. You're no journalist. She's no secretary. You're the Riviera jewel thieves, aren't you?\\n\\nHailey: Us?\\n\\nGrace: You think you can pull the wool over my eyes? Me, the expert on every convoluted film plot ever written? The star of half the crime melodramas ever made? I rumbled you two the moment you met here.\\n\\nBoniface: Is this true?  You are the Riviera jewel thieves?\\n\\nJimmy: (BASHFUL) Well.... I suppose there's no point in denying it now.\\n\\nOscar: Good God!\\n\\n> Adam: Bloody hell!\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nOscar: (POINTING AT ADAM)  Is he your lover, or isn't he your lover?\\n\\nGrace: Of course he's not my lover.\\n\\n> Adam: Of course I'm not her lover.\\n\\nOscar: How do I know that?\\n\\nGrace: He blows the other way, you fool!\\n\\nOscar: What?\\n\\nGrace: He's gay.  He's a poof.  Aren't you, Adam?\\n\\n> Adam: Yeh.\\n\\nOscar: You're gay?\\n\\n> Adam: Bent as a hairpin. But don't tell my fans.\\n\\n( ... )\\n\\nGrace: We're not really such a bad team, are we?\\n\\nOscar: No.  Oh, I'm relieved!  I didn't really want to lose you.\\n\\nGrace: Of course you didn't.  Where else would you find a prima donna like me to brighten your life?\\n\\n> Adam: Exactly.\\n\\nGrace: You'd be bored to death without me to dramatise our affairs.\\n\\nOscar: And you'd be lost without me to manage your affairs.\\n\\nGrace: Of course I would.

I'd like it if you'd be less snarky.\\n\\n> Jovie: I came here last year too, my first Christmas in New York.\\n\\nBuddy: Oh, where'd you come from?\\n\\n> Jovie: L.A.\\n\\nBuddy: L.A.? Never heard of that place. I don't think Santa goes there.\\n\\n> Jovie: He doesn't. Christmases there are surreal. No snow.\\n\\nBuddy: No snow?!? That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.\\n\\n> Jovie: You know, when I was a kid I dreamed of having a snowy Christmas Eve dinner at Tavern on the Green.\\n\\nBuddy: You know what? We are going to have Christmas Eve Dinner at Tavern on the Green!\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't think so. For one thing, it's been closed for months. It just re-opened, now it's even harder to get in.\\n\\nBuddy: My dad can get us a table! He can do anything!\\n\\n> Jovie: Buddy, don't promise things you can't deliver.\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie, I will make your dream come true. I promise.\\n\\n> Jovie: Wow, I might actually have a real Christmas.\\n\\nBuddy: You see? You do have Christmas Spirit!\\n\\n> Jovie: I guess I do. A little.\\n\\nBuddy: Now you have to spread it around and remember the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.\\n\\n> Jovie: I told you, I don't sing.\\n\\nBuddy: What do you mean, you don't sing?\\n\\n> Jovie: I mean I don't sing for anyone, at anytime, under any circumstances, and that includes birthdays, Bar Mitzvahs and especially Christmas. Okay?\\n\\nBuddy: (singing) COME ON, JOVIE, SINGING CAN BE EASY\\n\\n> Jovie: Please stop.\\n\\nBuddy: IT'S FUN, IT'S FREE AND BEST OF ALL IT'S...\\n\\n> Jovie: Totally cheesy?\\n\\nBuddy: AND MAKE IT SOUND PRETTY\\n\\n> Jovie: No.\\n\\nBuddy: BY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR\\n\\n> Jovie: People are staring\\n\\nBuddy: Come on, Jovie! Try it for me!\\n\\n> Jovie: (singing)  \\nJUST SING A CHRISTMAS SONG,  \\nIT'S LIKE MAGIC IF THINGS GO WRONG.  \\nJUST SPREAD SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER  \\nBY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO...  \\n\\n# Act 2\\n## Scene 2\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie! I know you are super mad right now. Wow. You look more miraculous than ever.\\n\\n> Jovie: And you look... seasonally appropriate.\\n\\nBuddy: Thanks!\\n\\n> Jovie: You are two and a half hours late.\\n\\nBuddy: I have a really good explanation.\\n\\n> Jovie: Go ahead.\\n\\nBuddy: I forgot about our date.\\n\\n> Jovie: That's your explanation? You forgot?\\n\\nBuddy: I remembered it eventually, but for a long time I forgot, which is why I'm late. Oh! Is this Tavern on the Green? With all the lights? Pretty.\\n\\n> Jovie: Yes, I'm sure some lucky couple had a wonderful evening sitting at our table.\\n\\nBuddy: No they didn't.\\n\\n> Jovie: Why not?\\n\\nBuddy: Because we didn't have a table. I was going to ask my Dad to get us on---\\n\\n> Jovie: But you forgot.\\n\\nBuddy: No. I remembered, but he got really mad at me for making it snow in his offic---\\n\\n> Jovie: Stop. Just. Stop. I can't take any more of your crazy stories.\\n\\nBuddy: But it's true! And, oh, Jovie, I am so, so sorry I ruined your Christmas dream.\\n\\n> Jovie: Forget it. It's my fault. I knew you couldn't get a table. But still, I got all dressed up and came here. And then an hour went by, then another hour and I waited. I didn't leave. Why? Because our date on Thursday was the only good time I've had in the last year and a half. How sad is that?\\n\\nBuddy: That is sad. But it's nice too.\\n\\n> Jovie: I just thought that if anyone could give me a real Christmas it would be you. \\\"Lower your expectations, so you don't get disappointed.\\\" I should have that tattooed on my butt.\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie I feel so bad about this, sick in my stomach, like a swallowed a zillion sticks of Juicy Fruit. The last thing in the whole world I wanted to do was hurt you.\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm cold, and my feet are killing me in these heels...\\n\\nBuddy: Can I just give you a Christmas present?\\n\\n> Jovie: This is the worst possible tim---\\n\\nBuddy: Here. This is what New York City looks like when it snows. Shake it. Pretty, huh? Real snowflakes are smaller than buildings. Keep it, and look at it later when you're not furious. It's real special. I mean, I know you're not going to believe me, but Santa Claus gave it to me when I left the North Pole.\\n\\n> Jovie: Oh, Buddy. I so, so wish that were true. Goodbye.\\n\\n# Act 2\\n## Scene 6\\n\\nBuddy: ... And the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! Everybody! Sing! Sing! Anybody? (Silence)\\n\\n> Jovie: (singing) JUST SING A CHRISTMAS SONG, IT'S LIKE MAGIC IF THINGS GO WRONG. JUST SPREAD SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER BY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR. (Speaking) Come on people! Get into it!\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie? You're here! I thought you were mad at me.\\n\\n> Jovie: I was, but then you made it snow!\\n\\n# Epilogue\\n\\nWalter: Shhh! Buddy!

And that was our dance of the week — \\\"Peyton Place After Midnight,\\\" introduced to you by our brand-new Council member, Miss Tracy Turnblad.\\n\\n...\\n\\nEdna: She can't hear you. (the phone rings and she answers it.) Hello?... Yes. This is her childhood home. No I'm not her father. \\n\\n> Corny: So let's wave a wistful bye-bye to Brenda — see you next year.\\n\\nCouncil Members: Awww...\\n\\n> Corny: ...and inaugurate the newest member of our Council, Tracy Turnblad! Cozy up to old Corny and tell us about yourself, Trrrrace.\\n\\nTracy: Well, I go to Patterson Park High, I watch your show, and do absolutely nothing else. (all applaud and cheer) But someday I hope to be the first woman president of the world or a Rockette. You got to think big to be big!\\n\\n> Corny: And if you were president, what would your first official act be?\\n\\nTracy: Well, I'd make every day Negro Day!\\n\\nVelma & Spritzer: Aaaaaiiieeeeeee!!!!!!\\n\\n> Corny: I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Trace! What do you say, kids? Looks like we might just have a hot new candidate for Miss Teenage Hairspray.\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) no, she can't be miss hairspray! She's the before in the Metrecal diet ad, and I'm the after, and afters always win!\\n\\n> Corny: Amber, what the comedian! (bonks Amber on the head) So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) No! He can't because everyone knows that whenever he sings, he sings to me, he's completely involved with me, see?\\n\\n> Corny: Right. So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\\n\\nTracy: Would I? Would I?\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) You people are ignoring the laws of nature!\\n\\n> Corny: Link Larkin, our own budding Elvis, will now sing to the equally blooming Tracy Turnblad his version of this week's Top 40 hit, \\\"It Takes Two.\\\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nSpritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, Negro Day everyday? That chubby communist girl and kissing on the mouth with possibly parted lips... I assure you, controversy is not what Ultra Clutch wishes to promote.\\n\\n> Corny: Negroes and chubby girls buy hairspray, too, Mr. Spritzer.\\n\\nSpritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, how do you plan to handle this?\\n\\nVelma: I plan to start by firing him!\\n\\n> Corny: You can't fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collings Show.\\n\\nVelma: Why not? They do it all the time on Lassie!\\n\\n> Corny: Mr. Spritzer, to keep your audience, you got to keep up with the times.\\n\\nVelma: This show's fine the way it is.\\n\\n> Corny: Bringing Tracy on is just beginning. I've got terrific ideas for updating the show.\\n\\nSpritzer: I'm getting one of my sick headaches. Is there a place where I might lie down?\\n\\nVelma: There's a bed in my office. (Spritzer leaves) So you've got ideas, do you? And going behind my back to put this no talent Commie on the show is one of them?\\n\\n> Corny: Damn right, Velma. It's time we put kids on the show who looks like the kids who watch the show.\\n\\nVelma: Not while I'm producing it.\\n\\n> Corny: I was thinking it might be time to change that, too.\\n\\nVelma: Are you threatening me, Collins?\\n\\n> Corny: Aw, you know me, Velma! On the other hand, I could always take the show to Channel 11. (Corny exits laughing)\\n\\n# Act 2\\n# Scene 5 - Miss Teenage Hairspray\\n\\n(Drum Roll...

(looking at the scoreboard) Presently, it appears Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad are neck and neck. But since, according to the latest police bulletins, Miss Turnblad is still at large...\\n\\nAmber: At VERY large.\\n\\n> Corny: ...our Miss Hairspray might just be a foregone conclusion. Still, our rules say contestants have to dance for it. Are you ready, Amber?\\n\\n...\\n\\nAmber: Thank you ladies, gentlemen and kids. I'm now ready to consume the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray.\\n\\n(Corny leads Spritzer on. Spritzer carries the crown and bouquet.)\\n\\n> Corny: Just to be sure, I think we'd better check the board.\\n\\nSpritzer: Could we please see the tally?\\n\\n(all turn to the board and amber wins by a few votes)\\n\\nYes, Amber Von Tussle just squeaks in as the winner.\\n\\nAmber: What did I tell you? Give me the crown, give me the flowers, and everybody start bowing!\\n\\nTracy: Not so fast, Amber. Look who's coming in the front door.\\n\\n> Corny: Right on schedule! I mean, I know nothing about this complex plan. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the never to be counted out Tracy Turnblad.\\n\\n...\\n\\n### after: You can't stop the beat\\n\\n(applause)\\n\\n> Corny: Everyone, look... Look at the scoreboard! (all look) Tracy Turnblad, I declare you Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!\\n\\n...\\n\\nTracy: Of course you, Link. But I also want a graduate degree in Musicology with a minor in the ethnic studies. And if there's something else I'd like to say - The Corny Collins Show is now and forever more officially integrated! (Cheers fill the room)\\n\\n> Corny: America look up! Here's history right before your eyes. Television will never be the same.\\n\\n...\\n\\nPrudy: And you look so happy. I can't say it's what I want, but if this fine looking cat-like black boy is responsible for the light in your eyes, then how could I object?\\n\\n> Corny: Live television - there's nothing like it.\\n\"},{\"id\":\"kpy5pfljos\",\"title\":\"MusicManHaroldHill\",\"content\":\"## Scene 1\\n\\nCharlie: ...

You were a pretty big slicker when you were in business with me.\\n\\nMarcellus: Too many close shaves the way you work. Besides I got me a nice comfortable girl — Ethel Toffelmier — boss's niece.\\n\\n>Harold: Gone legitimate huh?

She's the librarian — female.\\n\\n>Harold: Perfect! That's what I wanted to hear. If she passes by point her out to me.\\n\\nMarcellus: I will. How are you gonna start the pitch?\\n\\n>Harold: Same old way. Keep that music teacher off balance — and then my next step will be to get your town out of the serious trouble it's in.\\n\\nMarcellus: River City isn't in any trouble.\\n\\n>Harold: Then I'll have to create some. I have to create a desperate need for a Boys' Band. You remember — Now what's new around here. What can I use?\\n\\nMarcellus: Nothin' — except the Bullard parlor's just put in a new pool table.\\n\\n>Harold: They never had a pool table here before?\\n\\nMarcellus: No — only billiards.\\n\\n>Harold: That'll do.

Heed the warning before it's too late! Watch for the tell-tale signs of corruption! The moment your son leaves the house does he rebuckle his knickerbockers below the knee? Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger? A dime novel hidden in the corn crib? Is he memorizing jokes out of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang? Are certain words creeping into his conversation?

And you'll hear the thunder of rolling Drums; the shimmer of trumpets — Tantara!

Handy, (Slam) and John Philip Sousa all came to town on the very same historic day.\\n\\n\\nMayor Shinn: (exiting) Men, I want that spellbinder' credentials.\\n\\n>Harold: Constable, I'll be responsible for the boy.\\n\\nConst: You don't know this kid — he's tough, and he's got his gang waitin' outside.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh, I'll be careful. Tommy, like to talk to you about the band.\\n\\nTommy: Aw gee, Professor, that's for the little kids.\\n\\n>Harold: I'm not talking about you playing in the band. You're mechanically minded, aren't you? Ever do anything with perpetual motion?\\n\\nTommy: Nearly had it a couple times.\\n\\n>Harold: You did? You're my man! Do you realize that nobody has ever invented a music-holder for a marchin piccolo player? (Holds arms in playing position) No place to hang the music.\\n\\nTommy: Jeely Kly! Wonder where I could get some wire from.\\n\\n>Harold: Look in your cellar, that's where people keep wire. (Tommy starts tearing out. The constable makes a move, Harold restrains him.) Oh, Tommy!\\n\\nTommy: Yessir?\\n\\n>Harold: Now Constable, I'll show you how to break up a gang. Oh young lady. Oh miss — what's your name?\\n\\nZaneeta: Zaneeta.

Escort the young lady home.\\n\\nZaneeta: Only excepting I'm not going home. I have to go to the Liberry. Ye Gods.\\n\\n>Harold: Then escort the young lady home by way of the library — (Takes out coins) by way of the candy kitchen.\\n\\nTommy: Yes sir. Do I hafta?\\n\\n>Harold: You hafta.\\n\\nTommy: Yes sir.\\n\\nZaneeta: Ye Gods.\\n\\nConst: Professor, you're a bright young fellow. You made a couple mistakes, though.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh?\\n\\nConst: The Mayor happens to own the Billiard Parlor and that new pool table.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh.

At what college do they give a degree for annoying women on the street like a Saturday night rowdy at a public dance hall?\\n\\n>Harold: Oh I wouldn't know about that. I'm a conservatory man myself. Gary, Indiana Gold medal Class of '05.\\n\\nMarian: [...] which may very well give me some interesting information about you.\\n\\nMarcellus: Hey, Gregory!\\n\\n>Harold: Oh hi, Marcellus. And don't call me Greg.\\n\\nMarcellus: How'd you make out with the music teacher?\\n\\n>Harold: Scrumptious. Ate out of my hand the minute I tipped my hat.\\n\\nMarcellus: She did! [...] Just like when you used to imitate that band-concert fellow back in Joplin.\\n\\n>Harold: Yeah! (Pantomimes conducting) Aw, kid stuff. I'm in rare form these days, son. Just you keep your eyes on me for the next four weeks.\\n\\nMarcellus: Four weeks! It only used to take ten days for the instruments to arrive.\\n\\n>Harold: It still does. But it takes four weeks for the uniforms.\\n\\nMarcellus: Oh no, Greg! You haven't added uniforms!!???\\n\\n>Harold: Uniforms and instruction books.\\n\\nMarcellus: Instruction books! But you can't pass yourself off as a music professor — I mean not for any four weeks.\\n\\n>Harold: (Ruefully) Marce —\\n\\nMarcellus: But you don't know one note from another.\\n\\n>Harold: I have a revolutionary new method called the Think System where you don't bother with notes.\\n\\nMarcellus: But in four weeks the people will want to hear the music! You'll have to lead a band.\\n\\n>Harold: When the uniforms arrive they forget everything else — at least long enough for me to collect and leave. Oh this is a refined operation, son, and I've got it timed right down to the last wave of the brakeman's hands on the last train out'a town. And now, Mr. Washburn, if you'll excuse me —\\n\\nMarcellus: Gonna line yourself up a little canoodlin' huh? Say, I could fix you up with Ethel's sister — lovely girl — teaches Sunday school —\\n\\n>Harold: No wide-eyed, eager wholesome innocent Sunday School teacher for me. That kinda girl spins webs no spider ever — listen boy —\\n\\n### The Sadder But Wiser Girl\\n\\n\\nEulalie: Oh, I couldn't say. I could not say. Oh no. I could not say, at this time. My husband will wish to investigate, I'm sure. And naturally I'm reticent. Oh yes, I'm reticent.\\n\\n>Harold: Of course, Mrs. Shinn, I understand. But you see, part of my music plans include a committee on the dance and — no wait — wait! Do that again, Mrs. Shinn! Your foot! The way you raised it, just now!\\n\\nEulalie: Oh. Well I have a bunion there that bothers —\\n\\n>Harold: Ohhh what grace! What natural flow of rhythm! What expression of line and movement!\\n\\nEulalie: Mr. Hill.\\n\\n>Harold: You must accept the chairmanship of the Ladies Auxiliary for the Classic dance, mustn't she, ladies?\\n\\nWomen: Oh yes! Please! You must Eulalie.\\n\\n>Harold: Every move you make, Mrs. Shinn, bespeaks Del Sarte. Will you — will you? Say yes, Mrs. Shinn!\\n\\nEulalie: Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn — ah — well! I — ah — that is — Dancing! Well!\\n\\n>Harold: Then you accept?\\n\\nEulalie: Yes indeed! And I would like to say —\\n\\n>Harold: Thank you. Now the young lady who plays the piano — Marian Paroo, I believe? (Ladies gasp) After all, she is the librarian.\\n\\n### Pick a Little\\n\\n\\nMaud: [...] she advocates dirty books.\\n\\n>Harold: Dirty books!\\n\\n\\nEulalie: [...] who never had a friend in town till she came — old Miser Madison.\\n\\n>Harold: (Puzzled) Miser Madison. Madison Gymnasium, Madison Picknic Park, Madison Hospital — that Miser Madison?\\n\\nMaud: Exactly. Who'd he think he was anyway?\\n\\n>Harold: Well I should say. Show off. Gave the town the library too, didn't he?\\n\\n\\nJacey: Just a minute here! We need your credentials.\\n\\n>Harold: Yes, of course. I have just what you want over at the Hotel. Come with me. (As Quartet starts to follow, to Ladies:) Goodnight ladies. (To Quartet:) GOODNIGHT LADIES.\\n\\n\\n## Scene 7: Song 18: Marian the Librarian\\n\\n>Harold: It's all right — I know everything and it doesn't make any difference.\\n\\nMarian: What are you talking about?\\n\\n>Harold: You were probably very young — any one can make a mistake —\\n\\nMarian: What —\\n\\n>Harold: No apologies — no explanations, please. I'll only be in town a short time and — (Chuckles) — the sadder, but wiser girl for me.\\n\\nMarian: Will you please make your selection and leave.\\n\\n>Harold: I have.\\n\\nMarian: Well? What do you want to take out?\\n\\n>Harold: (Loudly) The librarian.\\n\\nMarian: Quiet please.\\n\\n>Harold: (Whispering) The librarian. You're not listening, Marian. (Takes a paper bag out of pocket) Look! (Sings) MAAAAAARIAN. (Speaks) Marbles. Six Steele's, eight aggies, a dozen peewees and one big glassie with an American flag in the middle. I think I'll drop 'em.\\n\\nMarian: No!\\n\\n>Harold: Shh! (Sings) MADAM LIBRARIAN [...]\\n\\n### Near end of librarian song\\n\\n>Harold: The Ladies' Dance Committee meets Tuesday nights. Marshmallow? (Sings) MADAM LIBRARIAN.\\n\\n## Scene 8\\n\\n>Harold: Well Tommy we've had a pretty good morning. Eleven sales out of twelve tries. Tell you what — It's almost noon. You better go home and get some dinner. I'll try a couple by myself.\\n\\nTommy: G'bye, Professor.\\n\\n>Harold: Thanks, Tommy.\\n\\n## Scene 9\\n\\nMayor Shinn: Just a minute here. Are you soliciting? You haven't got a license.\\n\\n>Harold: Why no, Mayor Shinn, I collect doorbells. This particular specimen has an unusual tone quality that —\\n\\nMayor Shinn: Flattery will not avail you. Soliciting is statutory in this county — malfeasance without a permit. Why haven't you been down't City Hall with your references?\\n\\n>Harold: Just missed you I — Mr. Mayor! Your hand — oh no!\\n\\nMayor Shinn: What, what —\\n\\n>Harold: That spread of the little finger! It's hereditary!\\n\\nMayor Shinn: Oh it is — what does that mean?\\n\\n>Harold: It means that your son's little finger is perfectly situated to operate the spit valve on a B-flat Flugel Horn!\\n\\nMayor Shinn: Is that good?\\n\\n>Harold: Good! It means that America has at last produced an artist who can flugel the minute waltz in 50 seconds.\\n\\nMayor Shinn: How could I get one of those horns?\\n\\n>Harold: Sign here, Mr. Mayor. That'll be seventeen dollars import fee.\\n\\nMayor Shinn: Yes sir. Just think […] you be down’t city Hall with your By God papers at three o’clock.\\n\\n>Harold: You mean this afternoon?\\n\\nMayor Shinn: I couldn’t make myself any plainer if I’se a Quaker on his day off.\\n\\n### Scene 10\\n\\n>Harold: Mrs. Paroo do you realize you have the facial characteristics of a Cornet virtuoso?\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: I don’t know if I understand you entirely, Professor.\\n\\n>Harold: If your boy has that same firm chin, and those splendid cheek muscles — By George! Not that he could ever be really great, you understand, but —\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Oh, is that so. And in the name of St. Bridget, why not?\\n\\n>Harold: Well — you see all the really great Cornet players were Irish — O’Clark, O’Mendez, O’Klein —\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: But Professor, we are Irish!\\n\\n>Harold: No! No! Really! That clinches it! Sign here, Mrs. Paroo. Your boy was born to play the Cornet! (She signs) Fine, fine. That will be seven dollars earnest money. Nothing more due until the first installment payable at opening of band practice. (She pays him) Ah thank you. And of course, I'll need the boy's measurements for his band uniform.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: His uniform! (Winthrop falls off the porch in excitement)\\n\\n>Harold: Hello, son. (Winthrop starts to run. Harold stops him) Certainly, his uniform. And there won't be a penny due till delivery, which gives him four weeks to enjoy, to anticipate, to imagine, at no cost whatever. Never allow the demands of tomorrow to interfere with the pleasures and excitement of today.\\n\\nWinthrop: Would it have... a... a...?\\n\\n>Harold: A stripe? Certainly, my boy, a wide red stripe on each side. What do you think of that?\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: You'll have to excuse him [...] Be-gob and be-jabbers! Where are you from, me bye?\\n\\n>Harold: Gary, Indiana.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: I knew it! Gar — . Where did you say?\\n\\n>Harold: Gary, Indiana. In fact Gary Conservatory was my Alma Mater.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Was she now?\\n\\n>Harold: (Aware of Marian's approach) Why yes — Gold Medal Class of '05. Hodado, Miss Paroo.\\n\\nMarian: Hodado, Mr. Hill.\\n\\n>Harold: Of course! Paroo. I thought the name sounded familiar. (Sotto) I've tried to see you since the other night, but —\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: He wants to put Winthrop in the band!\\n\\nMarian: We're not interested, mama.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: But Marian, the boy might have his father's musical gift. He does have my jaw, you know.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh — your husband musical? Well I'd like to have a talk with him. I'm sure we —\\n\\nMarian: Do you burst in on everyone's home like this? Prying into personal affairs? We're not interested.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Marian!\\n\\n>Harold: Well, that's one for and one against. Now why not let the boy's father decide?\\n\\nMarian: The boy's father is dead. Anything else?\\n\\n>Harold: Oh, I'm sorry. But that's all the more reason why your brother should have something like this —\\n\\nMarian: My brother is a ten year old [...] As to your musical tricks, why don't you go into business with a nice carnival man who sells gold painted watches and glass diamond rings?\\n\\n>Harold: Musical tricks? Well, Miss Paroo, I hardly — (Without response Marian exits into house. Mrs. Paroo stands speechless. Harold stands approvingly, his finger alongside his nose) I get the feeling she likes the idea. Oh, a little cautious perhaps but I admire that in a woman. Just keep me alive and I'll be back later in the week.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: One moment, Professor Hill. About the boy's measurements. I make all his clothes. Sleeve 21, Waist 18, Crouch 14, —\\n\\n>Harold: Fine, that's all I need. Now I must get back to the Hotel.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Professor, I do hope you'll excuse Marian. She's not really —\\n\\n>Harold: Please. Don't worry about a thing. I'm sure that at heart she's as lovely as yourself. Good day to ya, Widda Paroo.\\n\\n\\n## Scene 11\\n\\n\\nWinthrop: It'th the band inthtrumenth!\\n\\n>Harold: Here you are, Winthrop.\\n\\nWinthrop: My Cornet!

I've read that book you gave me from cover to cover for a whole week not and didn't find a thing!\\n\\n>Harold: Mr. Mayor, if you please —\\n\\nMayor Shinn: I'll settle your hash as soon as I get these premises offa' my oldest girl — yes.\\n\\n>Harold: All right but meantime I want you to know I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas. That boy's got the confidence of every kid in town — you'll be standing in line waiting to shake his hand by time our Band plays its first concert.\\n\\n\\nMarian: Professor Hill, I think Mayor Shinn has behaved abominably and I think it was wonderful of you coming to Tommy's defense.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh, that was nothing.\\n\\nMarian: Yes it was.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh, no. A man can't doge the issue every time a little personal risk is involved — (Watching her) What does the poet say? The coward dies a thousand deaths — the brave only 500 — (laughs gaily suddenly ties serious) Unfortunately, of course, the Mayor was already pretty mad on account of his Billiard Parlor. Now — (Shrugs ruefully) Oh I suppose a recommendation from a musical authority like yourself would help but — (leaving) I couldn't think of asking you to do a thing like that.\\n\\nMarian: Why, Professor Hill.\\n\\n>Harold: You would?\\n\\nMarian: I'd be glad to. I just wish I was a little more informed — I'be been wanting to talk to you about Winthrop's Cornet.\\n\\n>Harold: His Cornet? Mother-of-pearl keys.\\n\\nMarian: I'm sure it's fine. [...] he made a few — ah — experimental — blats? I guess you'd say?\\n\\n>Harold: Yes — yes, blats.\\n\\nMarian: And he sings the \\\"Minuet in G de da\\\" almost constantly.\\n\\n>Harold: La de da de da de da de da. La de da. La de da —\\n\\nMarian: But he never touches the  Cornet.\\n\\n>Harold: Well, you see —\\n\\nMarian: He says you told him it wasn't necessary.\\n\\n>Harold: Well.\\n\\nMarian: He tells me about some \\\"Think System.\\\" If he thinks the \\\"Minuet in G\\\", he won't have to bother with the notes. Now, Professor —\\n\\n>Harold: Miss Marian. The Think System is a revolutionary method, I'll admit. So was Gallileo's conception of the Heavens, Columbus' conception of the egg — ah — globe. Bach's conception of the Well-Tempered Clavicord. Hmm? Now I cannot discuss these things here in public. But if you'll allow me to call — (Spotting the ladies who are entering hastily) When may I call?\\n\\n\\n# Scene 2\\n\\nEwart: Sorry, Professor, but we got our orders.\\n\\nOliver: We all been deputized.\\n\\n>Harold: Yes — congratulations. Let's see now — you know all week I've tried to get you fellows my references and credentials, but every time you seem to get off the subject somehow. Now I have just what you want up in my hotel room — take me a second.\\n\\nEwart: Sorry. 'Fraid I'll have to go along with you.\\n\\n>Harold: Yes — well, let's see if I have my key — (Finds paper in pocket) What's this? — Oh — a testimonial from Madame Rini, the only female bassoon player ever to appear on the Redpath Circuit. Her stage name, of course. Actually she was from Moline. Lida Rose Quackenbush.\\n\\nEwart: Could I see that for a minute?\\n\\n>Harold: (Hastily pocketing it) Oh, you'll never forget the name. Lida Rose. Same as the old song. (Gets out pitch pipe and blows it) LIDA ROSE I'M HOME AGAIN, ROSE,\\n\\n## Scene 3\\n\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Marian... Marian! Marian dear! Who was you talkin' to just — Why Professor Hill!\\n\\n>Harold: Mrs. Paroo! The top a' the evening! Miss Marian.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Well, I'll put some on.\\n\\n>Harold: Shall we \\\"set\\\" as your mother said?\\n\\nMarian: Well, I...\\n\\n>Harold: You did ask me to call...?\\n\\nMarian: Did I?... I didn't mean anything...\\n\\n>Harold: Now Miss Marian, I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but Academic enlightenment. (Marian looks at him quizzically) The Think System? I've been by your house to try to explain it to you a time or two this week but there always seemed to be people around — mostly ladies I thought.\\n\\nMarian: Yes, Mrs. Squires and several of the ladies.\\n\\n>Harold: I'm glad — wouldn't want anybody beating my time. (Laughs) You wouldn't? No ma'am... Well... it's evidently not the convenient night. See you at the Sociable later. (Starts to leave)\\n\\nMarian: Professor Hill... Is it true that you've — had a hundred... what I'm trying to say is...\\n\\n>Harold: Yes?\\n\\nMarian: Is it really true that you've developed a... a Think System?\\n\\n>Harold: A what? A Think System? Oh — Think System — yes. It's really very simple. As simple as whistling. Nobody has to show you how to use your lips in whistling. You only have to think a tune to have it come out clearly here. (Pointing to her lips) Now just try this yourself, before you ask any questions. (Puckers up)\\n\\nMarian: I take your word.\\n\\n>Harold: Could we sit down?\\n\\nMarian: Are all music teachers as dense as I am?\\n\\n>Harold: All music teachers?\\n\\nMarian: I daresay you meet dozens — even a hundred —\\n\\n>Harold: Well I —\\n\\nMarian: Have they all been fascinated as I have with... the Think System?\\n\\n>Harold: Some more, some less. One young lady had thought up the same system before I got to her town. She showed me a few refinements...\\n\\nMarian: I see...\\n\\n>Harold: Have I sad something wrong?\\n\\nMarian: Please don't let me keep you, Professor Hill. You must have many more important things to do than to explain the Think System to me.\\n\\n>Harold: Can't think of one.\\n\\nMarian: And I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.\\n\\n>Harold: Now saaaay... where'd you get an idea like that?\\n\\nMarian: One hears rumors of traveling salesmen.\\n\\n>Harold: Now, Miss Marian — you mustn't believe everything you hear. After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.\\n\\nMarian: I suppose you're referring to Uncle Maddy?\\n\\n>Harold: Uncle Maddy?\\n\\nMarian: Mr. Madison — my father's best friend. No matter what they say he left me an assured job so Mother and Winthrop and I would have some security. Surely you don't believe...\\n\\n>Harold: Of course not! That's exactly what I'm saying. But why do you think people start those rumors?\\n\\nMarian: Narrow-mindedness, jealousy — jealousy mostly, I guess.\\n\\n>Harold: Exactly. And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen. (Catching her off guard. Quietly) What have you heard?\\n\\nMarian: Oh — oh nothing about you personally — just generally —\\n\\n>Harold: What have you heard generally?\\n\\nMarian: Just that — (Harold is very close to her) but of course [...] I mean, now honestly — mightn't they?\\n\\n>Harold: Why?\\n\\nMarian: (Racing on) And, so you say — if another salesman — or somebody were jealous — I mean — well, they could be downright lies — couldn't they?\\n\\n>Harold: (Confused) What could?\\n\\nMarian: Rumors and things.\\n\\n>Harold: Why of course.\\n\\nMarian: It just proves you should never believe everything you hear, doesn't it? I mean if you discuss things...\\n\\n>Harold: Miss Marian, I would be delighted to discuss anything in the world with you. But couldn't we do it sitting down? (Trying to lighten her mood) You do sit?... Your knees bend and all.\\n\\nMarian: We could sit on the porch steps.\\n\\n>Harold: We could also sit on a large hollow log over't the footbridge.\\n\\nMarian: I couldn't think of it. I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.\\n\\n>Harold: Just to talk.\\n\\nMarian: I've got to dress for the Sociable.\\n\\n>Harold: Then meet me there in fifteen minutes.\\n\\nMarian: I just can't — please — some other time — maybe tomorrow.\\n\\n>Harold: My dear little librarian —Pile up enough tomorrows and you'll find you've collected nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you but I'd like to make today worth remembering.\\n\\nMarian: Oh — so would I.\\n\\n>Harold: The footbridge — fifteen minutes.\\n\\n## Scene 4 the Footbridge\\n\\nMarcellus: Psst! Hey Greg! [...] The people are going to be screaming for music of those kids show up at the Sociable.\\n\\n>Harold: Yeah —\\n\\nMarcellus: Here's most a' the dough. [...] Pretending to hold a practice over't the lumber yard.\\n\\n>Harold: All right, Marce. Get the rig.\\n\\nMarcellus: I got it!\\n\\n>Harold: What time's the freight go?\\n\\nMarcellus: Nine-forty from the junction.\\n\\n>Harold: Well it's not even eight-thirty yet —\\n\\nMarcellus: Look, you wanta turtle-wurtle around here and get yourself caught in a bunny-trap, you go ahead, but —\\n\\n>Harold: Don't worry, Marce. I'll meet you at the Hotel in plenty a' time. (Marce exits as Marian enters) Miss Marian! (They rush toward each other and meet on the bridge) You're late.\\n\\nMarian: But you said fifteen minutes —\\n\\n>Harold: I meant that you were about — Well I'd say — about twenty-six years late — took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.\\n\\nMarian: If you want to know the truth it was almost longer.\\n\\n>Harold: Oh?\\n\\nMarian: Halfway here I nearly turned back. I suppose I'm not the first to find it easier to think clearly when not under the spell of your salesmanship.\\n\\n>Harold: Now Miss Marian — surely you don't think I've been selling you anything.\\n\\nMarian: No — you've given me something. That's why I deceived to come.\\n\\n>Harold: (Bewildered) I don't recall giving —\\n\\nMarian: Oh yes, you have! [...] But that's no reason for me not to be grateful for what you will have left behind for me!\\n\\n>Harold: (Beginning to protest) Marian — I —\\n\\n### Till there was you\\n\\n>Harold: Marian, there's a lot of things you don't know about me —\\n\\nMarcellus: Psst! Hey Greg!\\n\\n>Harold: Excuse me. I'm expecting a cable from Hector Berlioz — this could be it. (Hurries to meet Marcellus) Now what?\\n\\nMarcellus: Who's the salesman here? Sounds like she's selling and you're buying.\\n\\n>Harold: You nuts? I didn't know I'se goin' to be able to leave tonight — I had to keep her off balance, didn't I? I told you —\\n\\nMarcellus: Well, she's so far off balance now you can't tell her from a cat boat in a hurricane.\\n\\n>Harold: Listen Buster Brown, I've come up through the ranks on this skirmish — I'm not resigning without my commission.\\n\\nMarcellus: But Greg, you can't get anywhere right out here on the footbridge —\\n\\n>Harold: There's a place over't Madison Park near the Sociable makes this footbridge look like the old ladies home. Now beat it. Go get the rig. (Marcellus exist as Harold returns to Marian) Never a peaceful moment in the music business. (Preparing for the kill) Now then, where were we?\\n\\nMarian: You were about to tell me what I don't know about you.\\n\\n>Harold: (Trying to retract) Yeah — well we really don't have to go into that just now — do we —\\n\\nMarian: No, we don't — or ever for that matter, Harold. The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately — but she did plenty when you first came here.\\n\\n>Harold: (Slightly apprehensive) Oh — about what?\\n\\nMarian: About Professor Harold Hill, Gary Conservatory of Music — Gold Medal Class of '05. Harold, there wasn't any Gary Conservatory in '05.\\n\\n>Harold: Why there certainly —\\n\\nMarian: Because the town wasn't even built till '06. (Kisses him) I'll see you at the Sociable.\\n\\n>Harold: (Calling after her) You knew all the time?!\\n\\nMarian: (Taking a paper from her bosom) Since July 7th — three days after you came. I tore this page out of the Indaiana Journal. (Handing him the paper) It was originally intended to use against you but now I give it to you with all my heart.\\n\\n>Harold: But if you knew — why didn't you — (Marian throws him another kiss as she exits) Why you little —\\n\\n## Scene 5\\n### Double Reprise\\n\\n\\nCharlie: [...] Lilligags me around till I couldn't get to Shinn!

I've been looking all over for you! Where've you been?\\n\\nMarian: (Rushing to him) Harold! I've been looking for Winthrop — he's run away! Please go! Please, Harold, they're even talking about tar and feathers!\\n\\n>Harold: I had to see you, Marian —\\n\\nMarian: It's all right! Don't you know that? You don't owe me a word — not a word — Please, hurry, please —\\n\\nMarcellus: [...] Let's try down by the crick!\\n\\nMarian: Winthrop! (Grabbing him. Winthrop breaks away but Harold grabs him)\\n\\n>Harold: Hey, wait a minute here, son.\\n\\nWinthrop: I'm not your thon! Leave go me!\\n\\n>Harold: Not till I talk to you for a minute.\\n\\nWinthrop: I won't lithen!

You wanted the truth, didn't you? Now I'm bigger'n you and you're going to stand here and get it all so you might as well quit wiggling. (Winthrop stops) There's two things you're entitled to know. One, you're a wonderful kid. I thought so from the first. That's why I wanted you in the band, just so you'd quit mopin' around feeling sorry for yourself.\\n\\nWinthrop: What band?\\n\\n>Harold: ... I always think there's a band, kid.\\n\\nWinthrop: What'th the other thing I'm entitled to know?\\n\\n>Harold: Well — actually the other thing isn't any your business now that I think of it.\\n\\n\\nWinthrop: (Bursting into tears) Go on, profethor, hurry up.\\n\\n>Harold: I can't go, Winthrop.\\n\\nWinthrop: Why not?\\n\\n>Harold: For the first time in my life I got my foot caught in the door.

It's just that he never talks very much.\\n\\nAmaryllis: Not even to you and your mother?\\n\\n>Marian: No, dear. We all have to be a little patient.\\n\\nAmaryllis: I'm patient.

Prying into personal affairs? We're not interested.\\n\\nMrs. Mrs. Paroo: Marian!\\n\\nHarold: Well, that's one for and one against. Now why not let the boy's father decide?\\n\\n>Marian: The boy's father is dead. Anything else?\\n\\nHarold: Oh, I'm sorry. But that's all the more reason why your brother should have something like this —\\n\\n>Marian: My brother is a ten year old problem child who can't understand why his father was taken away. Would you care to explain it to him? He's been brooding about it for two years. As to your musical tricks, why don't you go into business with a nice carnival man who sells gold painted watches and glass diamond rings?\\n\\n(Dialogue then) Harold: (...) Good day to ya, Widda Mrs. Paroo.\\n\\n>Marian: Has he gone?\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: He has. And I hope not forever. Darlin' don't you ever think of your future? Gary Indiana Conservation Class of '05 — Now darlin' —\\n\\n>Marian: Now mama. Surely a girl's future doesn't depend on encouraging every fast-talking, self-centered, woman-chasing traveling man who comes to town. And the fact that he claims his commodity is music does not, in this particular case, impress me.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: All right, darlin', all right. Only it's a well-known principle that if you keep the flint in one drawer and the steel in another, you'll never strike much of a fire.\\n\\n>Marian: Mama! (calling) Winthrop! Winthrop, I know you're there. (he comes to the porch) Please go to the library and ask Miss Grubb to give you the book I set aside. It's the Indiana State Educational Journal 1890-1910. It's a large brown volume with black corners.\\n\\nWinthrop: Do I hafta?\\n\\n>Marian: You won't have to talk to anyone. I've written it all down. (She gives him paper. He goes) Thank you, dear.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Now what are you up to? Why do you need books at this hour of the night?\\n\\n>Marian: I have a feeling the Indiana Journal may help me poke some large holes in the Professor's claims.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Well, I give up. At your age if you don't mind my askin' what kinda white knight do you expect to come ridin' along?\\n\\n>Marian: Well I'm not waiting for Luther Greiner who backs me into the Ancient History shelf every time he comes into the Library.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: He does?\\n\\n>Marian: Or Ed Gammidge and that buggy of his with the removable back seat. But I'm not waiting for a man in shining white armor either.

I got to leave this dynamite... with somebody on the way't the deppo. 'Bye, girly-girl. See you next time through. (train whistle heard)\\n\\n>Marian: You'll never make that train at the depot. You'll have to catch it at the crossing. (gestures left)\\n\\nCharlie: No sir. I've got to leave word. And I can see you ain't the one to leave it with.\\n\\n>Marian: Just a minute — Mr. Cowell — you — don't know me yet.\\n\\nCharlie: Is that an invitation?\\n\\n>Marian: No — I meant I don't know you, and —\\n\\nCharlie: Yes — I'd need more time anyway —\\n\\n>Marian: I mean as well as I'd like to —\\n\\nCharlie: No trouble there, girly-girl. (he moves in)\\n\\n>Marian: (drawing back) I never met a man who sells anvils. That's someting — well — quite different.\\n\\nCharlie: Takes a real salesman (...) And I got to leave word about that fellow Hill!\\n\\n>Marian: Leave word with me.\\n\\nCharlie: Not on your tintype. HOw do I know you'd deliver these letters.\\n\\n>Marian: Try me.\\n\\n(she kisses him, the Quartet sings Lida Rose)\\nQuartet: (singing)\\n\\n>Marian: (Simultaneous with singing) There's your train! Now run for it!\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: You and Marian come up and set. I — I've — I've got some jelly on the stove.\\n\\n>Marian: There's no jelly on the stove, Mama.\\n\\nMrs. Mrs. Paroo: Well, I'll put some on.\\n\\nHarold: Shall we \\\"set\\\" as your mother said?\\n\\n>Marian: Well, I...\\n\\nHarold: You did ask me to call...?\\n\\n>Marian: Did I?... I didn't mean anything...\\n\\nHarold: Now Miss Marian, I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but Academic enlightenment. (Marian looks at him quizzically) The Think System? I've been by your house to try to explain it to you a time of two this week but there always seemed to be people around — mostly ladies I thought.\\n\\n>Marian: Yes, Mrs. Squires and several of the ladies.\\n\\nHarold: I'm glad — wouldn't want anybody beating my time. (Laughs) You wouldn't? No ma'am... Well... it's evidently not the convenient night. See you at the Sociable later. (Starts to leave)\\n\\n>Marian: Professor Hill... Is it true that you've — had a hundred... what I'm trying to say is...\\n\\nHarold: Yes?\\n\\n>Marian: Is it really true that you've developed a... a Think System?\\n\\nHarold: A what? A Think System? Oh — Think System — yes. It's really very simple. As simple as whistling. Nobody has to show you how to use your lips in whistling. You only have to think a tune to have it come out clearly here. (Pointing to her lips) Now just try this yourself, before you ask any questions. (Puckers up)\\n\\n>Marian: I take your word.\\n\\nHarold: Could we sit down?\\n\\n>Marian: Are all music teachers as dense as I am?\\n\\nHarold: All music teachers?\\n\\n>Marian: I daresay you meet dozens — even a hundred —\\n\\nHarold: Well I —\\n\\n>Marian: Have they all been fascinated as I have with... the Think System?\\n\\nHarold: Some more, some less. One young lady had thought up the same system before I got to her town. She showed me a few refinements...\\n\\n>Marian: I see...\\n\\nHarold: Have I sad something wrong?\\n\\n>Marian: Please don't let me keep you, Professor Hill. You must have many more important things to do than to explain the Think System to me.\\n\\nHarold: Can't think of one.\\n\\n>Marian: And I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.\\n\\nHarold: Now saaaay... where'd you get an idea like that?\\n\\n>Marian: One hears rumors of traveling salesmen.\\n\\nHarold: Now, Miss Marian — you mustn't believe everything you hear. After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.\\n\\n>Marian: I suppose you're referring to Uncle Maddy?\\n\\nH: Uncle Maddy?\\n\\n>Marian: Mr. Madison — my father's best friend. No matter what they say he left me an assured job so Mother and Winthrop and I would have some security. Surely you don't believe...\\n\\nHarold: Of course not! That's exactly what I'm saying. But why do you think people start those rumors?\\n\\n>Marian: Narrow-mindedness, jealousy — jealousy mostly, I guess.\\n\\nHarold: Exactly. And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen. (Catching her off guard. Quietly) What have you heard?\\n\\n>Marian: Oh — oh nothing about you personally — just generally —\\n\\nHarold: What have you heard generally?\\n\\n>Marian: Just that — (Harold is very close to her) but of course, it stands to reason that — that disappointment and jealousy can lead to — I mean — take you for instance — your attentions to — to — customers and — and well, teachers might easily be misinterpreted mightn't they... I mean, now honestly — mightn't they?\\n\\nHarold: Why?\\n\\n>Marian: (Racing on) And, so you say — if another salesman — or somebody were jealous — I mean — well, they could be downright lies — couldn't they?\\n\\nHarold: (Confused) What could?\\n\\n>Marian: Rumors and things.\\n\\nHarold: Why of course.\\n\\n>Marian: It just proves you should never believe everything you hear, doesn't it? I mean if you discuss things...\\n\\nHarold: Miss Marian, I would be delighted to discuss anything in the world with you. But couldn't we do it sitting down? (Trying to lighten her mood) You do sit?... Your knees bend and all.\\n\\n>Marian: We could sit on the porch steps.\\n\\nHarold: We could also sit on a large hollow log over't the footbridge.\\n\\n>Marian: I couldn't think of it. I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.\\n\\nHarold: Just to talk.\\n\\n>Marian: I've got to dress for the Sociable.\\n\\nHarold: Then meet me there in fifteen minutes.\\n\\n>Marian: I just can't — please — some other time — maybe tomorrow.\\n\\nHarold: My dear little librarian —Pile up enough tomorrows and you'll find you've collected nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you but I'd like to make today worth remembering.\\n\\n>Marian: Oh — so would I.\\n\\nHarold: The footbridge — fifteen minutes.\\n\\n>Marian: Fifteen minutes. (he exits quickly. Marian's voice is suddenly loud and desperate) Mama!\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: What?\\n\\n>Marian: I just told Professor Hill I'd meet him at the footbridge in fifteen minutes.\\n\\nMrs. Paroo: Glory be and the saints be praised — it works!\\n\\n>Marian: What does?\\n\\n## Scene 4 the Footbridge\\n\\nHarold: Don't worry, Marce. I'll meet you at the Hotel in plenty a' time. (Marce exits as Marian enters) Miss Marian! (They rush toward each other and meet on the bridge) You're late.\\n\\n>Marian: But you said fifteen minutes —\\n\\nHarold: I meant that you were about — Well I'd say — about twenty-six years late — took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.\\n\\n>Marian: If you want to know the truth it was almost longer.\\n\\nHarold: Oh?\\n\\n>Marian: Halfway here I nearly turned back. I suppose I'm not the first to find it easier to think clearly when not under the spell of your salesmanship.\\n\\nHarold: Now Miss Marian — surely you don't think I've been selling you anything.\\n\\n>Marian: No — you've given me something. That's why I decided to come.\\n\\nHarold: (Bewildered) I don't recall giving —\\n\\n>Marian: Oh yes, you have! Something beautiful. That's why I came — and I'm glad! Oh, please don't be afraid that I expect too much more. One can't expect a traveling salesman to stay put. I know there have been many ports of call — and there will be many more. But that's no reason for me not to be grateful for what you will have left behind for me!\\n\\nHarold: (Beginning to protest) Marian — I —\\n\\n### Till there was you\\n>Marian: (sings Till There Was You)\\n\\nHarold: There's a place over't Madison Park near the Sociable makes this footbridge look like the old ladies home. Now beat it. Go get the rig. (Marcellus exist as Harold returns to Marian) Never a peaceful moment in the music business. (Preparing for the kill) Now then, where were we?\\n\\n>Marian: You were about to tell me what I don't know about you.\\n\\nHarold: (Trying to retract) Yeah — well we really don't have to go into that just now — do we —\\n\\n>Marian: No, we don't — or ever for that matter, Harold. The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately — but she did plenty when you first came here.\\n\\nHarold: (Slightly apprehensive) Oh — about what?\\n\\n>Marian: About Professor Harold Hill, Gary Conservatory of Music — Gold Medal Class of '05. Harold, there wasn't any Gary Conservatory in '05.\\n\\nHarold: Why there certainly —\\n\\n>Marian: Because the town wasn't even built till '06. (Kisses him) I'll see you at the Sociable.\\n\\nHarold: (Calling after her) You knew all the time?!\\n\\n>Marian: (Taking a paper from her bosom) Since July 7th — three days after you came. I tore this page out of the Indaiana Journal. (Handing him the paper) It was originally intended to use against you but now I give it to you with all my heart.\\n\\n## Scene 6\\n\\n### Chase\\n\\nHarold: Marian! I've been looking all over for you! Where've you been?\\n\\n>Marian: (Rushing to him) Harold! I've been looking for Winthrop — he's run away! Please go! Please, Harold, they're even talking about tar and feathers!\\n\\nHarold: I had to see you, Marian —\\n\\n>Marian: It's all right! Don't you know that? You don't owe me a word — not a word — Please, hurry, please —\\n\\nMarcellus: [...] Let's try down by the crick!\\n\\n>Marian: Winthrop! (Grabbing him. Winthrop breaks away but Harold grabs him)\\n\\nWinthrop: I with you'd never come to River Thity!\\n\\n>Marian: No you don't, Winthrop.\\n\\nWinthrop: Thithter! You believe him?\\n\\n>Marian: I believe everything he ever said.\\n\\nWinthrop: But he promithed uth —\\n\\n>Marian: I know what he promised us and it all happened just like he said. The lights. And the flags and colors. And the cymbals.\\n\\nWinthrop: Where wath all that?\\n\\n>Marian: In the way every kid in this town walked around here all summer, and looked and acted. Especially you! And the parents, too. Does Mama wish he'd never come to River City?\\n\\nWinthop: Well you do, don't you?\\n\\n>Marian: No, Winthop. Now go, Harold — please.\\n\\n##Scene 7\\n\\nShinn: Four score — (...) And if there are those, as I have heard, who are melting tar and collecting feathers, I will not say them nay!\\n\\n>Marian: (rushing up to the rostrum) Well I should think there ought to be some of you who could forget our everlasting Iowa chip-on-the-shoulder arrogance long enough to remember River City before Harold Hill arrived. Do you remember? Well, do you? Surely some of you ought to be grateful to him for what he's brought to River City and if so I should think you'd want to admit it.\\n\"},{\"id\":\"ohlp321x95f\",\"title\":\"ZombieProm\",\"content\":\"MISS STRICT: Well, well, well, what have we here, Johnny Come-Lately?\\n\\n>JONNY: No. Jonny Warner.\\n\\nMISS STRICT: Oh yes, our new transfer student.
