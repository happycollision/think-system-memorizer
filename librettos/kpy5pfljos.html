Don't change the channel! 'Cause it's time for the Corny Collins Show! Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray! For hair that holds up even in a NASA wind tunnel!\\n\\nEvery afternoon  \\nWhen the clock strikes four  \\nA crazy bunch of kids  \\nCrash through that door  \\n  \\nThey throw off their coats  \\nAnd leave the squares behind  \\nAnd then they shake it,  \\nShake it, shake it  \\nLike they're losing their mind  \\nYou'll never see them frown  \\n'Cause they're  \\nThe nicest kids in town  \\n  \\nEvery afternoon  \\nYou turn your TV on  \\n  \\nAnd we know you  \\nTurn the sound up  \\nWhen your parents are gone  \\n  \\nAnd then you  \\nTwist and shout  \\nFor your favorite star  \\n  \\nAnd once you've  \\nPracticed every step  \\nThat's in your repertoire  \\nYou better come on down  \\nAnd meet the  \\nNicest kids in town  \\n\\n...\\n\\nEdna: Don't be silly, it ain't colored. The TVs black and white.\\n\\n> Corny:  \\nNice white kids  \\nWho like to lead the way  \\nAnd once a month  \\nWe have our Negro day!  \\nAnd I'm the man  \\nWho keeps it spinning round  \\nMr. Corny Collins  \\nWith the latest, greatest  \\nBaltimore sound!  \\n  \\nSo every afternoon  \\nDropping every thing  \\n  \\nWho needs to read and write  \\nWhen you can dance and sing?  \\n  \\nForget about your algebra  \\nAnd calculus  \\nYou can always do your homework  \\nOn the morning bus  \\nCan't tell a verb from a noun  \\nThey're the nicest kids in town  \\n\\n> Corny & Kids: Roll Call!\\n\\nEdna: Turn that racket down. I'm trying to iron in here.\\n\\nGirls: (scream) AHH \\n\\n> Corny:  \\nSo, every night you're shaking  \\nAs you lie in bed  \\n  \\nAnd the bass and drums  \\nAre pounding in your head  \\nWho cares about sleep  \\nWhen you can snooze in school?  \\n  \\nThey'll never get to college  \\nBut they sure look cool  \\n  \\nDon't need a cap and gown  \\n'Cause they're the  \\nNicest kids in town  \\n  \\nThey're the  \\nNicest, nicest  \\nThey're the  \\nNicest, nicest  \\nThey're the  \\nSugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...  \\nKids in Town!  \\n\\n> Corny: Yeah! And that was our new dance of the week — the \\\"Stricken Chicken.\\\" We'll be right back.\\n\\n...\\n\\nVelma: And you, Mr. Collins! None of that Detroit sound today. You have something against Connie Francis? \\n\\n> Corny: The kids are just over the moon for rhythm and blues, Velma. They can't get enough.\\n\\n...\\n\\nVelma: Ah, ah, ah! None of that! Save your personal lives for the camera! And we're back in five... four... three...\\n\\n(the lights change to indicate we're back on the air) \\n\\n> Corny: Now don't forget, guys and Gidgets — our very first primetime spectacular is coming up on June 6th. We'll be live at Baltimore's brand-new Eventorium broadcasting nationwide! Talent scouts will be on hand from all of the major record labels, and sponsoring the event will be none other than our own ULTRA CLUTCH HAIRSPRAY. So, let's give a great big fawning Baltimore salute to the President of Ultra Clutch, Harriman F. Spritzer.\\n\\nSpritzer: Ultra Clutch is happy to bring you fine youngsters to national attention.\\n\\nAll: Our big break! \\n\\n> Corny: Also, live on the special, we'll be crowning your choice for Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!\\n\\n...\\n\\nAmber: Hey, gang, don't forget to watch mom and me next Thursday on mother daughter day. And I want to be your Miss Teenage Hairspray. Remember, a vote for me from you is a vote for me. \\n\\n> Corny: What an unexpected ad lib, Amber. And it speaking of expecting the unexpected, our own a fun loving, freewheeling Brenda will be taking a little leave of absence from the show. How long will you be gone, Brenda?\\n\\nBrenda: Nine months. \\n\\n> Corny: So, it seems we'll have an opening for a girl who is just as fun-loving, but maybe not quite as freewheeling. Wanna be one of the nicest kids in town? Cut school tomorrow and come down to station WZZT to audition!\\n\\n## Scene 5 - The Madison\\n\\n(Patterson Park High School gymnasium. Corny takes the mic.)\\n\\n> Corny: Hey, there, sophomores and sophomores at heart. I'm honored to be your guest DJ here at PPHS. So with no further a do-do, let's do-do some dancing. (music starts) It's the hottest dance around and it was born right here in Baltimore. What's it called kids?\\n\\nStudents: The Madison! \\n\\n> Corny: And where'd you see it first?\\n\\nStudents: The Corny Collins Show! \\n\\n> Corny: Let's form to big strong lines — it's Madison time! Go!\\n\\n...\\n\\nSeaweed: You keep your eye on Corny. This could be your big chance. \\n\\nTracy: You better keep an eye on me.\\n\\n> Corny: Now when I say \\\"Hit it,\\\" show me a big, bad Baltimore Box...... hit it!\\n\\nLittle Inez: How come we always have to dance in the back?\\n\\nSeaweed: I don't know. There's them and there's us. That's just the way it is.\\n\\n> Corny: When I say \\\"hit it,\\\" take it to the basket like Wilt the Stilt......hit it! (to Amber) Amber, who's your friend? She's like a breath of fresh, mountain air.\\n\\nAmber: You got the Mountain part right. Oink-oink. \\n\\n> Corny: Now when I say \\\"hit it,\\\" let's take a drive down Druid Hill....hit it! Hang a right....feed the monkey.....he's in the back seat.\\n\\nLink: Hey, little darlin'. Haven't we met somewhere? \\n\\nTracy: Ohmigod, Link Larkin just spoke to me. I'll never wash this ear again.\\n\\n> Corny: When I say \\\"hit it,\\\" let's make like Jackie Gleason — hommina, hommina, hommina....hit it!\\n\\nAll: And away we go!\\n\\nTracy: Hi, Corny!\\n\\n> Corny: Hey, cupcake. What's your name? \\n\\nTracy: I'm Tracy Turnblad. \\n\\n> Corny: What else have you got hiding in those Buster Browns?\\n\\n...\\n\\nAmber: Everybody stop liking her!!!! \\n\\n> Corny: OK everybody, let's take it home. Crazy! (The kids do the Madison) And that, Baltimorians, is how we do the Madison.\\n\\n## Scene 6 - Success\\n### Nicest Kids Reprise\\n\\nKids: Oh - oo - oo... Hoot hoot hoot hoo-oot\\n\\n> Corny: Hey there teenage Baltimore. You're just in time for the Corny Collins Show!\\n\\nSpritzer: Brought to you by Ultra Clutch! \\n\\n> Corny: And it tastes good too. Today's jam packed edition will feature Link Larkin singing a special request Top 40 hit \\\"It Takes Two.\\\" So, let the party begin!\\n\\n...\\n\\nTracy: And I'm Tracy!\\n\\nCouncil Members: Whoo!\\n\\n> Corny & Kids:  \\nSo, every night you're shaking  \\nAs you lie in bed  \\n  \\nAnd the bass and drums  \\nAre pounding in your head  \\n\\n> Corny:  \\nWho cares about sleep  \\nWhen you can snooze in school?  \\n  \\nThey'll never get to college  \\nBut they sure look cool  \\n  \\nDon't need a cap and gown  \\n'Cause they're the  \\nNicest kids in town  \\n  \\nThey're the  \\nNicest, nicest  \\nThey're the  \\nNicest, nicest  \\nThey're the  \\nSugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...  \\nKids in Town!  \\n\\n> Corny: Yeah! And that was our dance of the week — \\\"Peyton Place After Midnight,\\\" introduced to you by our brand-new Council member, Miss Tracy Turnblad.\\n\\n...\\n\\nEdna: She can't hear you. (the phone rings and she answers it.) Hello?... Yes. This is her childhood home. No I'm not her father. \\n\\n> Corny: So let's wave a wistful bye-bye to Brenda — see you next year.\\n\\nCouncil Members: Awww...\\n\\n> Corny: ...and inaugurate the newest member of our Council, Tracy Turnblad! Cozy up to old Corny and tell us about yourself, Trrrrace.\\n\\nTracy: Well, I go to Patterson Park High, I watch your show, and do absolutely nothing else. (all applaud and cheer) But someday I hope to be the first woman president of the world or a Rockette. You got to think big to be big!\\n\\n> Corny: And if you were president, what would your first official act be?\\n\\nTracy: Well, I'd make every day Negro Day!\\n\\nVelma & Spritzer: Aaaaaiiieeeeeee!!!!!!\\n\\n> Corny: I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Trace! What do you say, kids? Looks like we might just have a hot new candidate for Miss Teenage Hairspray.\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) no, she can't be miss hairspray! She's the before in the Metrecal diet ad, and I'm the after, and afters always win!\\n\\n> Corny: Amber, what the comedian! (bonks Amber on the head) So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) No! He can't because everyone knows that whenever he sings, he sings to me, he's completely involved with me, see?\\n\\n> Corny: Right. So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\\n\\nTracy: Would I? Would I?\\n\\nAmber: (grabbing the mic) You people are ignoring the laws of nature!\\n\\n> Corny: Link Larkin, our own budding Elvis, will now sing to the equally blooming Tracy Turnblad his version of this week's Top 40 hit, \\\"It Takes Two.\\\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nSpritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, Negro Day everyday? That chubby communist girl and kissing on the mouth with possibly parted lips... I assure you, controversy is not what Ultra Clutch wishes to promote.\\n\\n> Corny: Negroes and chubby girls buy hairspray, too, Mr. Spritzer.\\n\\nSpritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, how do you plan to handle this?\\n\\nVelma: I plan to start by firing him!\\n\\n> Corny: You can't fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collings Show.\\n\\nVelma: Why not? They do it all the time on Lassie!\\n\\n> Corny: Mr. Spritzer, to keep your audience, you got to keep up with the times.\\n\\nVelma: This show's fine the way it is.\\n\\n> Corny: Bringing Tracy on is just beginning. I've got terrific ideas for updating the show.\\n\\nSpritzer: I'm getting one of my sick headaches. Is there a place where I might lie down?\\n\\nVelma: There's a bed in my office. (Spritzer leaves) So you've got ideas, do you? And going behind my back to put this no talent Commie on the show is one of them?\\n\\n> Corny: Damn right, Velma. It's time we put kids on the show who looks like the kids who watch the show.\\n\\nVelma: Not while I'm producing it.\\n\\n> Corny: I was thinking it might be time to change that, too.\\n\\nVelma: Are you threatening me, Collins?\\n\\n> Corny: Aw, you know me, Velma! On the other hand, I could always take the show to Channel 11. (Corny exits laughing)\\n\\n# Act 2\\n# Scene 5 - Miss Teenage Hairspray\\n\\n(Drum Roll... Corny appears on stage)\\n\\n> Corny: And now, live, from the certified up-to-code Baltimore Eventorium... For the first time ever on nationwide television... it's The Corny Collins Spectacular...\\n\\nGirls: He's Corny!\\n\\n> Corny: Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray!  \\n  \\nWhat gives a girl  \\nPower and punch?  \\nIs it a charm, is it poise?  \\nNo, it's hairspray!  \\n  \\nWhat gets a gal  \\nAsked out to lunch  \\nIs it brains, is it dough?  \\nNo, it's hairspray  \\n  \\nIf you take a ride  \\nWith no can at to your side  \\nThen your flip will be gone with the wind  \\n  \\nBut if you spray it and lock it,  \\nYou can take off in a rocket  \\nAnd in outer space  \\nEach hair will be in place  \\n  \\nWhy take a chance  \\nWhen you get up and dance?  \\nIf you twist, I insist  \\nYou use hairspray  \\n  \\nAnd tell your mother  \\nHer head she should smother  \\nWith \\\"Ultra-Clutch\\\" faithfully  \\n  \\nSo if you're a redhead, a blond or brunette  \\nJust take my advice  \\nAnd you might just get  \\n  \\nThe only thing better than hairspray  \\nThat's me!  \\n  \\nForget the milk man  \\nThe only thing better than hairspray  \\nThat's me!\\n\\nEnsemble: Ah Ah Ah Ah...\\n\\n> Corny & Ensemble:  \\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  \\nWhat makes a man  \\nReach out and touch  \\nUltra clutch!  \\nSo if you're a redhead, a blonde or brunette  \\n\\n> Corny:  \\nJust take my advice  \\nAnd you might just get  \\n\\nThe only thing better than hairspray  \\nThat's me!  \\n\\nGirls: He's Corny Collins!\\n\\n> Corny:  \\nThe only thing better than hairspray  \\nThat's me  \\n\\nCouncilettes:  \\nSka-doo-dl-e-ya-do-wah\\n\\n> Corny & The Councilettes:  \\nSka-doo-dl-e-doo-wah-do-wah\\n\\n> Corny: \\\"Hey baby, you look like you could use a stiff one!\\\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nVelma: Get out! And coming back to Corny on camera one in 3...2...\\n\\n> Corny: And now for the talent portion of the competition where the frontrunner gals present a dance of their own creation. (looking at the scoreboard) Presently, it appears Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad are neck and neck. But since, according to the latest police bulletins, Miss Turnblad is still at large...\\n\\nAmber: At VERY large.\\n\\n> Corny: ...our Miss Hairspray might just be a foregone conclusion. Still, our rules say contestants have to dance for it. Are you ready, Amber?\\n\\n...\\n\\nAmber: Thank you ladies, gentlemen and kids. I'm now ready to consume the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray.\\n\\n(Corny leads Spritzer on. Spritzer carries the crown and bouquet.)\\n\\n> Corny: Just to be sure, I think we'd better check the board.\\n\\nSpritzer: Could we please see the tally?\\n\\n(all turn to the board and amber wins by a few votes)\\n\\nYes, Amber Von Tussle just squeaks in as the winner.\\n\\nAmber: What did I tell you? Give me the crown, give me the flowers, and everybody start bowing!\\n\\nTracy: Not so fast, Amber. Look who's coming in the front door.\\n\\n> Corny: Right on schedule! I mean, I know nothing about this complex plan. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the never to be counted out Tracy Turnblad.\\n\\n...\\n\\n### after: You can't stop the beat\\n\\n(applause)\\n\\n> Corny: Everyone, look... Look at the scoreboard! (all look) Tracy Turnblad, I declare you Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!\\n\\n...\\n\\nTracy: Of course you, Link. But I also want a graduate degree in Musicology with a minor in the ethnic studies. And if there's something else I'd like to say - The Corny Collins Show is now and forever more officially integrated! (Cheers fill the room)\\n\\n> Corny: America look up! Here's history right before your eyes. Television will never be the same.\\n\\n...\\n\\nPrudy: And you look so happy. I can't say it's what I want, but if this fine looking cat-like black boy is responsible for the light in your eyes, then how could I object?\\n\\n> Corny: Live television - there's nothing like it.\\n\"}"}</script>
