I'm Buddy the Elf and we're going to have fun together.\\n\\n> Jovie: Hi. I'm Jovie the elf and I seriously doubt it. Enjoying the view?\\n\\nBuddy: Yes. You're very pretty. Like a glittery angel. I'd like to stick you on top of the tree!\\n\\n> Jovie: Classy. You know what? I'm not a Christmas person, so dial down the elf speak, okay?\\n\\nBuddy: Uh oh. Sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol! Don't you know, the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear!\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't sing.\\n\\nBuddy: (singing) SOON YOU'LL BRING A SMILE TO EVERY PERSON YOU SEE\\n\\n> Jovie: I'm sparkle-twinkle-jolly-what?\\n\\nManager: Whatever turns your crank, Buddy.\\n\\n> Jovie: Good night.\\n\\nBuddy: Hey, wait a second. Would somebody like a hug?\\n\\n> Jovie: No, would somebody like a punch in the throat?\\n\\nBuddy: No.\\n\\n> Jovie: So, good night.\\n\\nBuddy: Wait. Do you... wanna eat food?\\n\\n> Jovie: Do I want to eat food?\\n\\nBuddy: Um-hmm. You know...\\n\\n> Jovie: Are you asking me out on a date?\\n\\nBuddy: Yes, right, that's it. A date!\\n\\n> Jovie: Oh, you don't want to go out with me.\\n\\nBuddy: Yes, I do!\\n\\n> Jovie: Why?\\n\\nBuddy: Well, because I like you. I feel really warm when I'm around you. And, um, my tongue swells up.\\n\\n> Jovie: Your tongue swells up?\\n\\nBuddy: Yeth, it doth. See?\\n\\n> Jovie: Well, it's weirdly nice that I make your tongue swell up, but I just don't see this date happening.\\n\\nBuddy: Oh, of course. I'm sure you already have a date tonight...(etc) I bet you have a different guy for breakfast every morning. It was dumb of me to ask.\\n\\n> Jovie: What the hell. I'm free Thursday.\\n\\nBuddy: Thursday? Thursday! Yesssss!!! This is going to be the best Thursday ever in the history of Thursdays!\\n\\n> Jovie: You know what? I find if you lower your expectations in life, you avoid a lot of disappointment. (She starts to leave and notices he isn't moving.) Don't you have a home to go to?\\n\\nBuddy: Sure. I have a home to go. A nice home, with a big bed. And walls and a ceiling and everything. I'm just going to stay here and put up a little more tinsel.\\n\\n> Jovie: Seriously? Okay. Well. Good night.\\n\\n# Act 1\\n## Scene 10\\n\\nBuddy: How did you like your dinner?\\n\\n> Jovie: Greasy souvlaki on a stick is not dinner.\\n\\nBuddy: But it's the world's best souvlaki...\\n\\n> Jovie: No. It's the world's crappiest souvlaki. (She drops it in the trash and apologizes to the vendor.) Sorry.\\n\\nVendor: No. Thank you for the feedback. I'll go home right now and change the sign.\\n\\n> Jovie: (to Buddy) Look, how about we just call it a night?\\n\\nBuddy: No! We've still got so much to do on our date. It's too early to take you home and get you into bed. Oh! How about dancing?\\n\\n> Jovie: Uh, no...\\n\\nBuddy: I'll go first! Ein zwei drei vier! (Gestures to Jovie) Take it, Jovie!\\n\\n> Jovie: I am so not going to take that.\\n\\nBuddy: Thank you. This one's a little flat.\\n\\n> Jovie: You are amazing on those things!\\n\\nBuddy: Well, I used to be in a band... Those were crazy, crazy days. Hey, did I tell you? You look miraculous.\\n\\n> Jovie: Miraculous, huh? Okay, well you look miraculous too. That elf getup made you look incredibly dorky.\\n\\nBuddy: Thanks!\\n\\n> Jovie: That wasn't a compli---\\n\\nBuddy: I know! It's the night before the night before Christmas. Let's do something Christmas-y!\\n\\n> Jovie: You want Christmas-y? Okay. Follow me!\\n\\nBuddy: Oh! Let's go skating!\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't skate.\\n\\nBuddy: I can teach you. I'm a real good skater. You have to be when you grow up at the North Pole.\\n\\n> Jovie: Stop. Let's make a pact. If you try to be less elf-y, I'll try to be less snarky.\\n\\nBuddy: Okay. I'd like it if you'd be less snarky.\\n\\n> Jovie: I came here last year too, my first Christmas in New York.\\n\\nBuddy: Oh, where'd you come from?\\n\\n> Jovie: L.A.\\n\\nBuddy: L.A.? Never heard of that place. I don't think Santa goes there.\\n\\n> Jovie: He doesn't. Christmases there are surreal. No snow.\\n\\nBuddy: No snow?!? That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.\\n\\n> Jovie: You know, when I was a kid I dreamed of having a snowy Christmas Eve dinner at Tavern on the Green.\\n\\nBuddy: You know what? We are going to have Christmas Eve Dinner at Tavern on the Green!\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't think so. For one thing, it's been closed for months. It just re-opened, now it's even harder to get in.\\n\\nBuddy: My dad can get us a table! He can do anything!\\n\\n> Jovie: Buddy, don't promise things you can't deliver.\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie, I will make your dream come true. I promise.\\n\\n> Jovie: Wow, I might actually have a real Christmas.\\n\\nBuddy: You see? You do have Christmas Spirit!\\n\\n> Jovie: I guess I do. A little.\\n\\nBuddy: Now you have to spread it around and remember the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.\\n\\n> Jovie: I told you, I don't sing.\\n\\nBuddy: What do you mean, you don't sing?\\n\\n> Jovie: I mean I don't sing for anyone, at anytime, under any circumstances, and that includes birthdays, Bar Mitzvahs and especially Christmas. Okay?\\n\\nBuddy: (singing) COME ON, JOVIE, SINGING CAN BE EASY\\n\\n> Jovie: Please stop.\\n\\nBuddy: IT'S FUN, IT'S FREE AND BEST OF ALL IT'S...\\n\\n> Jovie: Totally cheesy?\\n\\nBuddy: AND MAKE IT SOUND PRETTY\\n\\n> Jovie: No.\\n\\nBuddy: BY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR\\n\\n> Jovie: People are staring\\n\\nBuddy: Come on, Jovie! Try it for me!\\n\\n> Jovie: (singing)  \\nJUST SING A CHRISTMAS SONG,  \\nIT'S LIKE MAGIC IF THINGS GO WRONG.  \\nJUST SPREAD SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER  \\nBY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO...  \\n\\n# Act 2\\n## Scene 2\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie! I know you are super mad right now. Wow. You look more miraculous than ever.\\n\\n> Jovie: And you look... seasonally appropriate.\\n\\nBuddy: Thanks!\\n\\n> Jovie: You are two and a half hours late.\\n\\nBuddy: I have a really good explanation.\\n\\n> Jovie: Go ahead.\\n\\nBuddy: I forgot about our date.\\n\\n> Jovie: That's your explanation? You forgot?\\n\\nBuddy: I remembered it eventually, but for a long time I forgot, which is why I'm late. Oh! Is this Tavern on the Green? With all the lights? Pretty.\\n\\n> Jovie: Yes, I'm sure some lucky couple had a wonderful evening sitting at our table.\\n\\nBuddy: No they didn't.\\n\\n> Jovie: Why not?\\n\\nBuddy: Because we didn't have a table. I was going to ask my Dad to get us on---\\n\\n> Jovie: But you forgot.\\n\\nBuddy: No. I remembered, but he got really mad at me for making it snow in his offic---\\n\\n> Jovie: Stop. Just. Stop. I can't take any more of your crazy stories.\\n\\nBuddy: But it's true! And, oh, Jovie, I am so, so sorry I ruined your Christmas dream.\\n\\n> Jovie: Forget it. It's my fault. I knew you couldn't get a table. But still, I got all dressed up and came here. And then an hour went by, then another hour and I waited. I didn't leave. Why? Because our date on Thursday was the only good time I've had in the last year and a half. How sad is that?\\n\\nBuddy: That is sad. But it's nice too.\\n\\n> Jovie: I just thought that if anyone could give me a real Christmas it would be you. \\\"Lower your expectations, so you don't get disappointed.\\\" I should have that tattooed on my butt.\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie I feel so bad about this, sick in my stomach, like a swallowed a zillion sticks of Juicy Fruit. The last thing in the whole world I wanted to do was hurt you.\\n\\n> Jovie: I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm cold, and my feet are killing me in these heels...\\n\\nBuddy: Can I just give you a Christmas present?\\n\\n> Jovie: This is the worst possible tim---\\n\\nBuddy: Here. This is what New York City looks like when it snows. Shake it. Pretty, huh? Real snowflakes are smaller than buildings. Keep it, and look at it later when you're not furious. It's real special. I mean, I know you're not going to believe me, but Santa Claus gave it to me when I left the North Pole.\\n\\n> Jovie: Oh, Buddy. I so, so wish that were true. Goodbye.\\n\\n# Act 2\\n## Scene 6\\n\\nBuddy: ... And the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! Everybody! Sing! Sing! Anybody? (Silence)\\n\\n> Jovie: (singing) JUST SING A CHRISTMAS SONG, IT'S LIKE MAGIC IF THINGS GO WRONG. JUST SPREAD SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER BY SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR. (Speaking) Come on people! Get into it!\\n\\nBuddy: Jovie? You're here! I thought you were mad at me.\\n\\n> Jovie: I was, but then you made it snow!\\n\\n# Epilogue\\n\\nWalter: Shhh! Buddy! You'll wake the baby!\\n\\n> Jovie: It's okay, Papa Hobbs. The baby loves Buddy's singing!\\n\"}"}</script>
