.SCENE 2: ROBERT ARRIVES

FRANCESCA
Good afternoon.

He hands her a business card

ROBERT
Afternoon to you, ma'am. My name is Robert Kincaid, and the great National Geographic Magazine has sent me out to take pictures of these famous covered bridges you've got here. Except my editor told me there were seven of them, and I can only find six. This last one...

FRANCESCA
The Roseman Bridge, I bet.

ROBERT
Yes, that's the one. I'd be grateful if you just tell me where the bridge is, that's all.

FRANCESCA
It's not far, but the locals have taken down all the signs. Kind of a joke, I guess.

A car goes by and honks. Francesca smiles and waves.

ROBERT
You're not a local?

FRANCESCA
I live here. With my husband and kids. But –
(A bit surprised)
I'm not from here, no.

ROBERT
Your accent is Italian. I was in Naples just a little while ago.

FRANCESCA
You were?

ROBERT
Uh-huh. Now to get to this Bridge...

The mention of home made her feel funny for a moment. But she gets hold of herself and gives the directions

FRANCESCA
okay. To get to the Roseman Bridge from here, you head away from town and take a left at the third brown barn.

ROBERT
(Laughs)
Third brown barn. You know what? I only needed to be there for five minutes, it's too late to shoot today. So I think I'll just go check into the Motor Court and start again in the morning. I'm sorry I bothered you.

FRANCESCA
It's the brown barn with a bright blue silo beside it.

ROBERT
Oh, OK. I remember seeing that.

FRANCESCA
Then after the barn, turn left, and go around the tractor, which John leaves on the road this time of year.

ROBERT
On the unmarked dirt road.

FRANCESCA
It sounds worse than it is. If it would help, I can drive over there and you can follow me in your truck.

ROBERT
No, no. I don't want to be any trouble.

FRANCESCA
It's no trouble, I was going to the library anyway,
(Looking at her watch)
but it's closed now, so–if you're really only going to be there five minutes, there's no point to even taking two cars. I'll just ride with you, and then you can bring me back here on your way to the Motor Court.

ROBERT
Thanks. That's great. Thank you.

FRANCESCA
It's alright. When I first moved here, I got lost everyday. I'm Francesca.

They shake hands. Music starts

ROBERT
Much obliged.

They walked to the truck.

FRANCESCA
Where are you from, Mr. Kincaid? You sound like you might be Southern.

ROBERT
I was born in Texas, but I live in Seattle now.

Arriving at the truck

ROBERT
I'm sorry this truck is such a mess. Long trip like this I kind of live in it, so she gets real...

He opens the door and closes it

FRANCESCA
You just drove halfway across the country?

He seems relieved to be asked to a real question

ROBERT
I left eight days ago from Washington.
I've got a place there on the sound.
Took route 2 east out of Spokane.
Oh, this old truck, she's been around.
Went through Kalispell and North Dakota,
Hit Minnesota on the way.
Went around Lake superior,
Hit Des Moines earlier today.

And I've been looking for something
At ev'ry bridge that I crossed,
And sometimes you can feel
Like time becomes unreal
When you are temporarily lost.

FRANCESCA
Right, go right. I'm sorry

ROBERT
You spend your time behind the camera,
Sometimes you almost disappear.
You see a waterfall in Cameroon,
And start to wonder why we are here.
You've gotta touch it with your fingers,
And feel the way the water flows
Until you figure out the meaning.
At least, I think that's how it goes.

So I've been looking for something,
And who can reckon the cost?
You chase it every day.
You think you're on your way,
And then you're temporarily lost.

FRANCESCA
There it is. Just around the curve. Roseman Bridge.

ROBERT
And now, it seems to me
The way you find the key
Is to be temporarily lost.

.AT ROSEMAN BRIDGE

He pulls the truck over and stops

ROBERT
(Seeing the bridge)
Oh now, that's a beauty. Be perfect for a sunrise shot in the morning.
(Opening his door)
I'd like to do a little recon right now if you don't mind.

FRANCESCA
I'm fine. I haven't been over here for a long time. I'll just wait here.

She watches him as he approaches and examines the bridge. At some point, she finds a pad of paper from her purse into pencil and begins to sketch.

ROBERT
I know I said five minutes, but it could be more like ten.

FRANCESCA
Take your time.

ROBERT
Then I'll drive you back home.

FRANCESCA
...
Comes someone so ridiculous,
So earnest,
So strong?

It's clear enough that these are two great-looking people on either side of the bridge, in this bridge will be crossed. He returns from the bridge, get the car.

ROBERT
There we go. All done. You ready?
(A beat, then:)
Just give me one second.

He takes a final look, then the drive home.

FRANCESCA
...
Something holy—
Something newly born
Without a name.

ROBERT
What were you doing? Sketching the bridge?

FRANCESCA
No, no. Grocery list.

.AT FRANCESCA'S HOUSE

FRANCESCA
Just drive around to the back.

ROBERT
The back.

FRANCESCA
You can park in the shade there while I get us a glass of tea.

He stops the truck

ROBERT
I should get going.

FRANCESCA
I know, but aren't you hot? And the tea is already made.

ROBERT
All right, then.
(Then quickly)
But I need to keep my film as cool as I can. You don't have any extra ice, do you?

FRANCESCA
You can put your film in the fridge if you want. I read that photographers have to do that sometimes.

ROBERT
I'll just fill the cooler with ice. Thank you, though.

He gets his cooler and followed her into the house.

FRANCESCA
Okay. Come on in.

.INSIDE THE HOUSE

He sets down his cooler, not quite knowing what to expect. Then he watches as she takes her boots off, and pours them each a glass of tea.

FRANCESCA
I hope you like your tea with sugar.

ROBERT
I do.

She drinks her is down quickly

FRANCESCA
Ah.

ROBERT
Is that what you do first when you come in the house? Take off your shoes?

FRANCESCA
I guess I do. Not you, I see.

ROBERT
No ma'am. Real cowboy's supposed to die with his boots *on* if he can.

FRANCESCA
Is that how you think of yourself, as a cowboy?

She pours more tea

ROBERT
Not really. I don't know why it said that.

Then suddenly, she remembers the film.

FRANCESCA
Oh the ice!
(Opening the freezer section)
I was so thirsty I forgot about the ice for your film.

She pulls out eight trays

He brings the cooler to the fridge and they open ice cube trays – the old metal kind. This makes a lot of noise, and these trays are very cold. She makes a little yelp as the first one.

ROBERT
Wait. Let me help. These ice trays stick to your fingers worse than the ice.

And sure enough, he has some kind of trick that makes the ice cubes come out perfectly. She stands back and watches as he feels his cooler, picks the whole thing up and heads outside.

ROBERT
That should do it. I'll just go get my film.

----------

MICHAEL
Is that what you're going to do? Call mom for the rest of your life?

Robert reenters. He has a six pack of beer and has on a clean shirt.

ROBERT
Trouble?

FRANCESCA
No, no. Caroline and Michael are with their dad on their way to the Indiana State fair. It's the 4H national finals and Caroline has a very good chance of–
(Stopping herself)
I'm sorry. My children are at a gas station arguing about who gets to wear the lucky red shirt.

ROBERT
And you said the girl should get the shirt.

FRANCESCA
I did. How did you know?

ROBERT
Boy should have to work for his luck. Girls need it more, with everything they're up against.

She notices the beer

ROBERT
I had some beer in the cooler. I thought you might like to join me.

FRANCESCA
That sounds good, actually.

ROBERT
OK, then. One beer and then I'll leave you to your peace and quiet.

FRANCESCA
You washed up and put on a clean shirt.

ROBERT
I did. You can't count on those Motor Court showers. I figured I'd clean up while I had the chance. Here you go.

Hands her a beer

FRANCESCA
What do you mean, with everything girls are up against?

ROBERT
I guess it's just some of the stuff I've seen in the world.
(Stopping himself)
I shouldn't have said anything.

FRANCESCA
No, please.

ROBERT
Truth is, I started to just drive off in the truck, but then I thought that would be rude, after you were so nice to me, so I came back in. But I warn you, I am not very good company.

FRANCESCA
I'm glad you didn't leave. I was hoping maybe you'd show me some pictures of Naples. That's where I'm from.
(Sensing his reluctance)
Didn't you say you were in Naples recently?

ROBERT
I was. But I'm not sure I have those with me.
(There is an uncomfortable silence, then)
But I appreciate... all this.
(Now a toast)
To the National Geographic.

FRANCESCA
To the National Geographic.

They clink bottles. Then drink.

ROBERT
I've never been to the real middle of the country like this. It feels really empty.

FRANCESCA
I know. It's not what I dreamed of as a girl. But it's very quiet here. And the people are nice. Bud told me when we first met–

ROBERT
Is that what you call your husband? Bud? The mailbox says Richard Johnson.

FRANCESCA
Bud's what everybody's call him since he was a boy.

ROBERT
So "Bud" told you when you met –

FRANCESCA
... (Song)

BUD
You're never alone.

Then Bud leaves the stage and Robert and Francesca are alone

ROBERT
So the houses might look empty, but they're not.

FRANCESCA
No, no. Everybody is either working, or... looking out their windows.

ROBERT
Well. I guess that's my cue to go. Wouldn't want to your neighbors coming over to ask what my truck's doing in your backyard. I saw two restaurants in town for supper. Is either one of them–

FRANCESCA
Oh no. I wasn't thinking. Both those places are closed now. In the motor court only has a vending machine. There's really no place for you to eat until... Des Moines, and they might be closed by the time you get there.

ROBERT
It's okay. I've got some carrots in the truck. Coupla apples, that'll do. What time does everybody open up for breakfast?

FRANCESCA
Early. But that's when you want to be taking your pictures.

ROBERT
Okay then. I better get going.

FRANCESCA
(She knows he won't make it)
No, no. It's too late. Why don't I make you dinner, we could eat together, I mean. I can make pork chops and vegetables...

ROBERT
No, no. I can't. I'm good.

He stands as if to go. A moment

FRANCESCA
Mr. Kincaid. In Italy we would never let anybody leave hungry.

ROBERT
I know that alright. I never ate food like that in my whole life. Is there something you Italians know that the rest of us don't?

FRANCESCA
Maybe.

ROBERT
Okay then. I accept. But just vegetables for me. I don't eat meat anymore. It's not a big deal. I just feel better when I don't. Tell me what I can do.

FRANCESCA
Just go out to the garden and pick whatever looks good. Will make a vegetables do with dumplings. And salad. I'll get cleaned up and meet you right back here.

ROBERT
Sounds good.

----------

.BACK IN FRANCESCA'S KITCHEN

Robert is rinsing vegetables at the sink as she comes down the stairs. He has brought a beat-up acoustic guitar into the house with him and leaned against the wall she's wearing a clean pair of jeans and a white shirt, the sleeves rolled up, and sandals.

He turns around to look at her. He's knocked out by her beauty, and starts to say so. That changes his mind. She still smells of the shower and he's doing good to speak at all.

ROBERT
You... You've got an amazing garden.

FRANCESCA
Thank you.
(Then notices guitar)
Oh good. You brought in your guitar. I saw it in the back of the truck. I was hoping you maybe play something for me. I never get to hear any real music.

ROBERT
The guitar's not really mine. Well, I guess it is now. I mean, it belonged to my ex-wife, Marian. I can't play worth a damn, but it's not good to leave it outside. I don't want it in my house, though, and I can't leave it in the truck. So I don't know *what* to do with it.

FRANCESCA
Well, that's probably why she gave it to you.

ROBERT
I don't understand.

FRANCESCA
So you wouldn't forget her. Let's see what you've found for supper.

ROBERT
(Drying his hands)
It's all washed and ready. Squash, leeks, potatoes, carrots, fennel, basil, tomatoes.

FRANCESCA
My Poppa liked fennel. I think I'm the only person in this county who even grows it.

ROBERT
I had this amazing soup in Italy, in a tiny little town somewhere. I tried to remember what was in it, and just picked that. I could be wrong about the leeks, but I know there was fennel.

FRANCESCA
I can make you that soup.

ROBERT
So I did OK.

FRANCESCA
(Teasing him)
No kale, I see.

ROBERT
I don't like kale. Was I supposed to get kale?

FRANCESCA
No. It's kind of an American thing.

ROBERT
How about another beer?

FRANCESCA
I'm sorry I don't have anything else for us to drink. Though... There might be a bottle of brandy in that cupboard, if you want to look.

ROBERT
I could use a brandy. This cupboard?

FRANCESCA
I'll get it.

She puts down her knife and grabs the kitchen chair. With his help, she gets out on the chair and pushes things around in the upper cupboard until she finds the brandy.

Handing it to him

FRANCESCA
Here it is. I hope it's still good.

ROBERT
I'm sure it will be. It hasn't even been opened. How did it get there?

FRANCESCA
Oh I bought it once, a couple of years ago, thinking...
(Decides not to tell)
Thinking we might enjoy it. But I guess we never got around to it.

ROBERT
And do you still think you might enjoy it?

FRANCESCA
I wanted to know what it tasted like.

ROBERT
Well then. There's no time like the present.

He opens the bottle, looks in the cupboard, find two glasses and pours them each a drink.

FRANCESCA
I thought it was an after dinner drink.

ROBERT
Well normally it is, but after dinner tonight, I'm going to drive back to the Motor Court, so I can be at that bridge at dawn. And I think this bottle has waited long enough.

FRANCESCA
All right then.

They clink glasses again and she takes to sip

FRANCESCA
Oh my goodness. Is this what it's supposed to taste like?

ROBERT
Exactly.

FRANCESCA
I like how it burns a little, at the end.

ROBERT
You picked a good one.

FRANCESCA
Are you still in touch with your ex-wife? Marian?

ROBERT
No. And I don't know if my parents are alive, or where my brothers and sisters are...

FRANCESCA
I didn't mean to pry.

ROBERT
I keep to myself, that's all.
(Then realizing she's looking at him)
But I don't want to be rude. So. Ask away.

FRANCESCA
Skin these carrots. Was your ex-wife a photographer to?

ROBERT
No, she was a waitress... Who wanted to be a singer, or some kind of something else. She was young though, so... Who knows what she is now.

----------

FRANCESCA
I think it needs a little more pepper, what do you think.

ROBERT
Do you have a...

FRANCESCA
Pepper grinder, I sure do.

She opens the cabinet and gets it

ROBERT
You brought this with you from home.

FRANCESCA
I did. And a box of mamas recipes. I could make real mozzarella if anybody in Iowa would eat it.
(Then looks at him)
You would eat it.

ROBERT
With tomatoes and basil, you bet I would.

----------

MARIAN
Another life.
Another life.

ROBERT
That was a great supper. Let me clear the table.

----------

FRANCESCA
Everything's fine. I love you.

She hangs up the phone and Robert takes a sip from the stew

FRANCESCA
That was my husband.

Robert is listening up a little. He tries a question.

ROBERT
Why didn't you go with them?

He pours them another brandy.

FRANCESCA
They have a better time without me. Take hundreds of pictures of the stairs. So I just can just watch this slideshow when they get back. "Mom, mom, look at this pig!" OK. "And this watermelon." Wow. It's as big as the pig.

ROBERT
It's hard to take a good picture. Sometimes I see tourists taking pictures and I want to say, "get closer," you know? "Move in on the thing so we can see it." And turn your camera up to vertical, especially if you're taking pictures of people. People are vertical. Usually.
(A beat)
Are you an artist? I thought your sketch of the bridge was good.

FRANCESCA
Drawing is what I studied in school. It's all I ever wanted to do.

ROBERT
But you got married and moved to Iowa and...

FRANCESCA
And now I'm just draw for myself, when I have time.

ROBERT
I'll wash the dishes if you want. You dry.

FRANCESCA
No, no. I'll do them after you go.

ROBERT
(He smiles)
Okay. Roseman Bridge at dawn. I better get going.

He grabs his backpack and any cameras he brought into the house. They walked to the back door.

FRANCESCA
I enjoyed talking with you.

ROBERT
Thanks again for everything. But especially that wonderful supper. I don't remember the last time anybody cooked for me. And I was thinking maybe if you kept that brandy at the front of the cupboard, or even out on the counter, you might get a little more enjoyment out of it.

FRANCESCA
I'll try that. Good night. Take care.

ROBERT
A little twinge,
A little shock,
A little whisper at the bottom of your memory.
A sudden wind,
A gentle knock,
And then a russell in the leaves.
You hold your breath,
You check the lock,
You reassure yourself that nothing's at the window.

But you're wondering.
You're wondering.
You're wondering what that was.
Nothing's gonna happen.

FRANCESCA
Nothing's gonna happen.

ROBERT
You turn a key,
You flip a switch,
You settle back into the blissful unfamiliar.
You close your eyes,
But there's an itch,
A little hurt your heart retrieves.
But you ignore
The tiny twitch,
Pretend the feeling will be gone before the morning.

But you're wondering.
You're wondering.
You're wondering where you are.
Nothing's gonna happen.

ROBERT & FRANCESCA
Nothing's gonna happen.

ROBERT
But wouldn't it be fine to share
The weather in her eyes, her hair,
Her footsteps as she climbs the stair,
The shadow in her light?

But everything you know is true
And everything you want to do
And everything that makes you you
Collides against the night.
And nothing's black and white.

And you're wondering.
You're wondering.
You're wondering what to do.
You're wondering.
You're wondering.
Your wondering if it's true.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Nothing has to happen.

.SCENE 4: ROSEMAN BRIDGE

FRANCESCA
Mr. Kincaid? Mr. Kincaid...

He is behind her

ROBERT
Right here.

FRANCESCA
Oh, you scared me.

ROBERT
(As he shoots)
I'm happy to see you. How did you know I'd still be here?

FRANCESCA
(A moment)
You're causing quite a commotion in the town.

ROBERT
Oh, I know. People been drivin' by all day taking pictures of the hippie taking pictures of the bridge.

FRANCESCA
Did this ever happened before?

ROBERT
Everywhere I go. Like it's not right for a man to just be passing through. You'd think I'd be used to it. But I'm always suspect somehow. That time I went to Iceland, the lady wouldn't rent me a room because she said I was one of the Hidden People. Said her mother told her you should never go into a cave with a Hidden Person, so no room for me.

He waits, with his camera just below his eye.

FRANCESCA
Have you been working all day?

ROBERT
Not really. I've mainly been waiting.

FRANCESCA
For what?

ROBERT
It starts with the light.
It's like you wouldn't even know which way to look
Until the sun showed you a line,
Showed you a corner,
Built you a frame,
Then you can see.

He walks to her, points at the bridge

ROBERT
(Spoken:)
See?

Now he puts the camera in front of her

ROBERT
(Spoken:)
Now: See?

See the world!
Here's the world through a small, small window.
You thought it was bridge,
You thought it was the water,
You thought it was the sky...
It's the world, inside a frame.

And you wait.
And you wait.
And you wait.
And you...
Right there, something shifted! Something...
That tree threw a shadow! Did you...?

Excited but controlled, he clicks the shutter

ROBERT
There! There! There!
It's like all you didn't know that you were waiting for
Is just outside the frame,
And it can change
The way you see...

He lowers the camera

ROBERT
See the world!
Here's the world in a box forever.

He looks at Francesca. Sees something

ROBERT
Go stand over there.

She walks to where he's pointing. He raises the camera to his eye.

ROBERT
Don't look at me.
-Now:
Look at me.

She does. Electric.

ROBERT
Look at me.
There. There.
There. There.
There.

He continues taking pictures of her, and then the role is finished

ROBERT
There's the world.
There's the world in your face, Francesca.

Don't worry. This is not for them. This one is for me.

He puts the camera away, digs into his bag and pulls out the canteen.

ROBERT
OK. All done. Are you thirsty?

FRANCESCA
So thirsty.

They sit on the bench. He offers her a drink from his canteen

ROBERT
Here you go.

FRANCESCA
(As she drinks)
What happens after you take the pictures?

ROBERT
I'll drive into Des Moines tomorrow and send the rolls of film to New York. Then I'll wait around the Motor Court til they call me and say if I got what they want, or not. Then I'm off to New York to take pictures of the Hare Krishnas.

He brings out another package it is wrapped in brown paper

ROBERT
I brought you a present. I was going to leave it in your mailbox.

She gives him back the canteen and takes the package

FRANCESCA
What is it?

ROBERT
On my way out of Seattle, I picked up a big bag of mail. Last night I went through it and look what I found.

She opens the package. It's a magazine.

FRANCESCA
Is this what it looks like now?

ROBERT
The rest of it is on page 43. Naples Today. They said it was the most bombed city in the war. That's why they sent me there. To document the reconstruction.

When she arrives at the page, her eyes water suddenly.

ROBERT
I'm sorry. I thought it would make you happy.

She looks through the pages

FRANCESCA
It's all the places that were destroyed by the bombs. Only here, it's all back the way it was. This is where I went to the market with Mama. That's our church. And there's my... There's my bench.

ROBERT
I took that picture because it was the only thing that seemed to have survived intact.

FRANCESCA
That bench at the Harbor is where I waited for my fiancé, Paolo to come back from the war.

ROBERT
But he didn't come home.

FRANCESCA
No.
(There is a moment. she turns more pages.)
Oh look at it! I miss it so much. I didn't know how much. I ran away from home and now I can't get back. Please forgive me. Can I keep this?

ROBERT
I brought it for you.

FRANCESCA
I will look at it again on a day when I'm not so... weepy. I'm sorry. Will you come to supper tonight?

ROBERT
Of course. I'll go back to the Motor Court and clean up and be there in about an hour.

FRANCESCA
You can use my shower to clean up.

ROBERT
Okay then. I'll pack up and be right there.

FRANCESCA
Robert, thank you for this.

ROBERT
This is what we hope for, that someday, one picture will make a difference to somebody.

.SCENE 5: THE SECOND EVENING AT FRANCESCA'S HOUSE

They walk into the house Robert carrying the cooler

FRANCESCA
Shower is just down the hall there, and I'll take my bath upstairs.

ROBERT
Want a beer for your bath?

FRANCESCA
Thank you.

She takes the beer in the phone rings. He heads for the shower.

----------

.IN THE KITCHEN

Robert is finishing up cleaning a camera and she walks in. He looks up

ROBERT
You are so beautiful.

She stands perfectly still. She doesn't move. He gets up to move toward her.

ROBERT
Do you know how beautiful you are? How did I get here?

FRANCESCA
I invited you.
(They look at each other for a long moment)
Either that, or the patron saint of Iowa housewives sent you to me. Or my sister, Chiara. She would like this alright. I'm feeling like a boring housewife but you come along and I feel like myself again.

As she passes him, he raises his hand out to stroke her shoulder.

ROBERT
Is it okay if I touch you?

FRANCESCA
Is this what always happens when you come to a town? You meet a woman who opens up to you for some reason, she doesn't know why, and before she knows it, she's bought a new dress and invited you for dinner again and—

He stops

ROBERT
No. I tried to leave yesterday. I tried not to eat supper here. You saw that.

She laughs a little and nods, and maybe reaches her hand up to touch his hand on her shoulder

ROBERT
No, this isn't always what happens. I *never* let this happen. I never go into this world where people belong to each other.

Steps away a little

ROBERT
As soon as I know I got the shots they need, I will be gone and on to the next job. So I know I can't stay anywhere, regardless of what happens. This is why...

Taking his time to remind her

ROBERT
I never walk in the house, I never drink the tea, I never stay for supper, I never come back the next night, I never get this close, I never touch your arm, I never do this.

He kisses her

FRANCESCA
I understand.

ROBERT
And you don't do this either.

FRANCESCA
No. I don't.

They kiss again

ROBERT
So if you're going to make me go to the Motor Court, do it now, OK. I think I could leave now if you wanted me to.

He kisses her again

The phone rings. She starts not to answer it, but he motions to her to take it. She moves across the kitchen to the phone on the wall behind him

----------

FRANCESCA
Bye, Marge. Say hi to Charlie for me.

She hangs up the phone, gently separates from Robert and moves toward the sink. He walks to the radio.

ROBERT
So you're coming with me to Des Moines tomorrow?

FRANCESCA
If I'm invited.

ROBERT
You are. How would you feel about a little music?

FRANCESCA
I'd like that. I don't know what stations have the music though. We only use the radio to listen for the weather and the price of corn.

He finds the station with no trouble at all. She seems very nervous. She should be cooking now, but she doesn't want to. He finds a big-band song.

ROBERT
How's that?

FRANCESCA
I like it.
(She looks at the pasta on the counter)
Would you like to have supper? I could have the pasta ready in a minute.

ROBERT
What I would like to do... is dance.

The music begins to come up over them, like a fog creeping in the door. They moved toward each other.

FRANCESCA
Okay.

He smiles, puts his beer on the counter and takes her hand.

----------

MARGE
'Cause I'm ready and I'm waiting
Daddy, let me get closer to you.

Marge exits

As the song finishes in music, Francesca and Robert are dancing very slowly, her head buried in his neck. She tilts her head up.

They kiss.

He kisses her again and another melody comes up under the radio tune

ROBERT
What was I saying before about being lost?
The thing is, I knew where I was,
But not where I was going.
Why did I walk those mountains?
Why did I ride those ships?
Why did I watch those horses running wild?
Now I know.
Now I know.

All my life, I have been falling.
I have been falling into you,
Francesca.
Circling in the sky,
Looking for a harbor
Coming into view.
All my life, I have been falling
Into you.

FRANCESCA
Whatever this is...
...
To know this moment,
To cross this line.

ROBERT
Adding up all those minutes
Staring through all I saw,
How could I know the answer
Would it be you?

FRANCESCA
How could I know the answer
Will you be you?

ROBERT
Only you.

ROBERT AND FRANCESCA
All my life I have been falling.
I have been falling into you,
Francesca.
This is where I land.
You are what I've looked for.
Now is what it is true.
All my life,

ROBERT
I have been falling
Into you.

> ACT 2 <

.AFTER STATE FAIR SONG

ROBERT
Maybe you sleep so peaceful
Because you haven't got a worry in your head.
Mm.
Or maybe you keep your eyes closed
So you never have to get out of this bed.
Mm.
Well, you don't have to make the toast
Or get the kids to school,
So rest your head and stay here close to me.
There's nothin' in this world today
But who we are and who we want to be.

Maybe I'm being selfish.
I should get my things and walk out of that door.
Mm.
But maybe we both deserve this.
And besides, how could I keep from wanting more?
Mm.

And lying here with curtains drawn,
Your hair across my chest,
I can't think what else I would need to see.
There's nothing in this world today
But who we are and who we want to be.

COMPANY
Oh, Oh, (Etc.)

ROBERT
And maybe after all these years
Of lookin' for a home,
A woman in a farmhouse held the key.
There's nothing in this world today
But who we are and who we're meant to be.

FRANCESCA
That clock must've stopped. It can't be 10 o'clock in the morning.

ROBERT
Is that a bad time to be in bed?

A moment. Then he leans down to kiss her and then starts to stretch over her, but she stops him

FRANCESCA
I need to get up.

ROBERT
OK.

She sits up in the bed little, then realizes she is naked.

She looks around for a robot or something

ROBERT
This is when we need to be in a hotel, so we can just call downstairs and order some breakfast.

FRANCESCA
Coffee at least.

ROBERT
Coffee would be good. I can make you a cup. Should I go down and do that? Are you hungry?

FRANCESCA
I might be. I don't know.

ROBERT
OK. I'll cook too. How's toast and eggs?

FRANCESCA
No you shouldn't have to cook breakfast.

ROBERT
It's OK. I have to leave in a little while anyway, get my film to the post office in Des Moines.

FRANCESCA
Robert.

ROBERT
Yes.

FRANCESCA
Is what I felt with you... is that what other lovers feel all the time?

ROBERT
No.
(A moment)
It was you.

FRANCESCA
Well. It was never me before.

He kisses her gently.

ROBERT
Well. It's you now. And me. It's us now.

FRANCESCA
(Falling into him)
Oh Robert.

ROBERT
You still want to drive to Des Moines with me this morning? How far is it?

FRANCESCA
Far enough.

ROBERT
Far enough so I can kiss you in the street without getting shot?

FRANCESCA
I think so.

ROBERT
So why don't you get dressed and I'll make us a breakfast to go. I'll put the coffee in my thermos. Is there anything else you'd like me to do?

FRANCESCA
(Beginning to loosen up)
That you haven't done to me already?

ROBERT
I was thinking like milk the cow. Don't you farm people have chores?

FRANCESCA
I forget if we have a cow.

ROBERT
(Making as if to leave)
I'll go check.

FRANCESCA
Stop

He laughs, and goes back to kiss her with fierce happiness

FRANCESCA
Don't stop.

ROBERT
(Falling back into the bed)
I adore you.

.SCENE 2: THE KITCHEN/DES MOINES

They have coffee in the kitchen

FRANCESCA
You really did make the coffee.

ROBERT
I really did.

FRANCESCA
People laugh at me about that coffee pot.

ROBERT
Well, after the coffee I had in town yesterday, I'm glad to see it.

FRANCESCA
Bud thinks...

ROBERT
Do you take cream?

FRANCESCA
No.

ROBERT
I knew that.

FRANCESCA
How did you know that?

ROBERT
Well, I'm sure this cream is good...

FRANCESCA
It is. It's especially good whipped on top of–

ROBERT
Pecan pie.

ROBERT AND FRANCESCA
Or peaches.

ROBERT
But the coffee is better black.

FRANCESCA
This is good. Not everybody knows how to make a good cup of coffee.

ROBERT
The other day, you said... This life wasn't what you dreamed of as a girl.

FRANCESCA
No it wasn't.

They drive to Des Moines

----------

FRANCESCA
(Ending the song:)
Far enough that I could feel
Almost real.

ROBERT
And where is Chiara now?

FRANCESCA
Still in Naples. With husband number four, I think. Still convinced I've wasted my life trying to be... perfect.

ROBERT
And have you been back to Italy at all?

FRANCESCA
No. I'd love to go and take Carolyn and Michael. But it's money we don't have.

ROBERT
Still, you've been cooking for them, so that counts.

FRANCESCA
And I sang to them in Italian when they were little.

ROBERT
I wish I was drinking your coffee.

FRANCESCA
Here you go.

They laugh together about this

FRANCESCA
Michael should go to Italy. He should go somewhere. I'm worried that he's starting to hate everything here. Iowa is so flat, you feel like the only way out is to blast straight up like a rocket.

ROBERT
And you're worried what Michael might do to feel like he's "out of Iowa."

FRANCESCA
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

ROBERT
And what does Bud think?

FRANCESCA
But I won't tolerate her rebellion. I'm afraid he'll drive Michael away before he ... has a chance to leave on his own terms.

ROBERT
My father threw me out.

FRANCESCA
So it could be a good thing, you mean. You turned out just fine.

ROBERT
I guess.

FRANCESCA
What do you mean, you guess. Look at you.

The waitress brings them a check

WAITRESS
Can I bring you folks anything else?

ROBERT AND FRANCESCA
We're fine.

.SCENE 3 - THE EVENING. FRANCESCA'S BEDROOM

FRANCESCA
Ah!! I liked being out in the world with you today.

ROBERT
Well, I don't know if I call Des Moines "the world," but I liked it too. Then again, I've never felt like this so I don't know what to call anything.

FRANCESCA
Felt like what?

ROBERT
Dizzy. And happy. I don't feel like we are in Iowa. I feel like we've been picked up in a tornado and we're on our way to...

The phone rings

----------

BUD
Goodnight.

Robert feels something new from her but isn't sure what it is.

ROBERT
Do you want me to go?

FRANCESCA
No, please.

----------

-Torn in half:
Before and after you.

ROBERT
I love you, Francesca.

FRANCESCA
And I love you. More than my own life, I love you.

ROBERT
For the first time in my life,
I am not outside moment
With a camera in between me and the world
I think I know.
For the first time in my life,
I am somehow part of something.
You surround me, you connect to me,
And I think I can't let go.
For the first time in my life,
You have opened up a channel
There is nothing to contain us,
We are joined, and we are free.
For the first time in my life,
I am risking something precious.
I am asking you, Francesca:
Come with me.

I can't tell you I know what the future will be.
Who knows anything?
I just look at those eyes; you've got so much to see.
Let me show you. There's
Crowds and camels and hillsides to climb.
All I know is, in all of the time
From man's first breath
To God's last warning,
You and I are just one second,
Spinning by in one split second.
You and I have just one second
And a million miles to go.

I don't need to be rich, I don't need something new.

FRANCESCA
I don't want to go back to a world without this.

ROBERT
All I need, all I've needed my whole life was you.

FRANCESCA
If I left this behind...

ROBERT
Please just look at me
You were born with a wanderer's soul.
This is how you begin to be whole.
The stars keep burning,
Worlds keep turning

ROBERT AND FRANCESCA
And you and I are just one second,
Spinning by in just one second,
You and I have just one second

ROBERT
And a million miles to go...

FRANCESCA
Found and lost.
Torn in half.
Before and after you.

ROBERT
Come with me.

FRANCESCA
Open-heart,
Open-door.
Before and after you.

ROBERT
Come with me.

FRANCESCA
How do I go?
Tell me.
How do I go?
How do I go with you?
How do I pack a bag,
Close the door,
Turn a key,
Walk away?
Look at where I am
And who I am
And tell me.
Is there something I don't know?
How do I go?
How can I go
With you?

ROBERT
I can't tell you I know what the answer will be.
It's impossible.
But this thing, this is bigger than what we can see.
This is destiny.
We are tied, we are locked, we are bound;
This will not be reversed or unwound.
Whatever fate the stars are weaving,
We're not breaking,
I'm not leaving,
And do you and I are just one second.
Spinning by and just one second.
You and I have just one second...

FRANCESCA
And a million miles to go.

ROBERT
All my life I have been falling...

FRANCESCA
All my life I have been falling...

ROBERT
All my life I have been falling into...

FRANCESCA
All my life I have been falling...

ROBERT
You and I

ROBERT AND FRANCESCA
Have just one second

ROBERT
And a million miles to go.

.SCENE 4 - FRIDAY MORNING

It is nearly noon. Robert jumps out of the bed.

ROBERT
Oh my God, Francesca, it's almost noon.

FRANCESCA
No. It can't be. They couldn't be here in an hour. It could be here in half an hour.

ROBERT
Do you know what time they were leaving?

She jumps out of bed, put a robe on and begins to strip the sheets off the bed.

FRANCESCA
Maybe Bud told me, but I wasn't listening. You have to leave. I have to change that. I have to clean the kitchen and get dressed and...

ROBERT
Francesca. It's at least an eight-hour drive from Indianapolis, so even if they left at seven, you've got at least three hours before they get here, maybe four.

FRANCESCA
Robert. They can't find you here.

ROBERT
Listen, I'll be in town all afternoon. But if George has the pictures he needs, I'll have to leave for New York by six.

FRANCESCA
But what if I can't get there by six?

ROBERT
Then I'll wire you the money to come to New York. Or call the magazine. They always know how to find me. You call me and I will come get you. All you have to do, ever, is call.

FRANCESCA
If you carry me to the truck right now and force me to go with you, I would ago.

ROBERT
Is that what you want?

FRANCESCA
No, I don't want to leave without seeing them. I'm afraid if I did, the guilt of knowing how I have hurt them would turned me into someone you wouldn't love it all.

ROBERT
No. Not possible.

FRANCESCA
Don't leave me, Robert.

ROBERT
I'm not leaving you. I'm waiting for you.

He runs down the stairs and she follows

FRANCESCA
Robert!

ROBERT
Six o'clock.

----------

FRANCESCA
Oh Robert. I love you. Take me with you.

ROBERT
OK. Let's go.

.SCENE 5 - YEARS GO BY

----------

FRANCESCA
Johnson's. Is someone there?

Shift 10 years and then to Robert's office

We hear the phone ringing again. The lights change, and we find Robert sitting at his desk, over a large trashcan, into which he is throwing his photos.

GINNY
National Geographic.

ROBERT
Hi Ginny. It's Robert Kincaid. Can you get George for me?

GINNY
He's in Nepal, Mr. Kincaid. He called you 100 times to get you to go with him. Where have you been?

ROBERT
You don't want to know. But I'm home now.

GINNY
George said if you called, he wants you there as soon as you can get there.

ROBERT
I can't go anywhere, Ginny. I called to say I'm kind of closing up shop here.

GINNY
You can't do that. You're the best we've got.

ROBERT
I don't know about that, but I'm not taking any more pictures. My doctors are telling me... Do you still have that number?—the one I gave you after I did those pictures of the covered bridges?

GINNY
I have it, but she hasn't called. Do you still want me to tell her how to find you?

ROBERT
No, don't give her the number now. I can't–Ginny, thank you so much for helping me wait for her call. In case she needed me.

GINNY
Of course. It was my pleasure.

ROBERT
Got to go now.

There was something in the desert.
There was some place wild and green,
And a child in a village I passed through.
There are places that I've traveled,
And so many things I've seen,
It all fades away but you.

He drops a stack of negatives in the trashcan and sets them on fire. Then another pile of them as well. And a final stack of prints. As the song goes on, we may see the photographs he is discarding been projected on the screen.

ROBERT
I was sliding down a mountain,
I was burning in the sun,
I was crying with amazement at the view.
I was capturing a moment,
But when all is said and done,
Well, it all fades away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.

Robert packs his cameras into a card box and closes it.

ROBERT
I have sailed across the oceans,
Past the cities and the farms,
On a never-ending quest for something new,
And the only things that mattered
Were the four days in your arms,
'Cause it all fades away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.

As the mandolin plays, Robert sings along, holding one last photograph. Finally, he puts it in the box and seals it.

ROBERT
There is one thing that's eternal,
That cannot be torn apart,
There is one thing that remains forever true.
Past the thinking, past the breathing,
Past the beating of my heart,
It will all fade away but you.
In all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.
In all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.
But you.
But you.
You.

.SCENE 6: THE BRIDGE

----------

ROBERT
You and I
Are just one second.
Spinning by
In one split-second.
You and I
Have just one second
And a million miles to go.
