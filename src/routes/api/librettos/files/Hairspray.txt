.SCENE 1

CORNY
Hey there, Teenage Baltimore! Don't change the channel! 'Cause it's time for the Corny Collins Show! Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray! For hair that holds up even in a NASA wind tunnel!

Every afternoon
When the clock strikes four
A crazy bunch of kids
Crash through that door

They throw off their coats
And leave the squares behind
And then they shake it,
Shake it, shake it
Like they're losing their mind
You'll never see them frown
'Cause they're
The nicest kids in town

Every afternoon
You turn your TV on

And we know you
Turn the sound up
When your parents are gone

And then you
Twist and shout
For your favorite star

And once you've
Practiced every step
That's in your repertoire
You better come on down
And meet the
Nicest kids in town

...

EDNA
Don't be silly, it ain't colored. The TVs black and white.

CORNY
Nice white kids
Who like to lead the way
And once a month
We have our Negro day!
And I'm the man
Who keeps it spinning round
Mr. Corny Collins
With the latest, greatest
Baltimore sound!

So every afternoon
Dropping every thing

Who needs to read and write
When you can dance and sing?

Forget about your algebra
And calculus
You can always do your homework
On the morning bus
Can't tell a verb from a noun
They're the nicest kids in town

CORNY & KIDS
Roll Call!

EDNA
Turn that racket down. I'm trying to iron in here.

GIRLS
(scream)
AHH

CORNY
So, every night you're shaking
As you lie in bed

And the bass and drums
Are pounding in your head
Who cares about sleep
When you can snooze in school?

They'll never get to college
But they sure look cool

Don't need a cap and gown
'Cause they're the
Nicest kids in town

They're the
Nicest, nicest
They're the
Nicest, nicest
They're the
Sugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...
Kids in Town!

CORNY
Yeah! And that was our new dance of the week — the "Stricken Chicken." We'll be right back.

...

VELMA
And you, Mr. Collins! None of that Detroit sound today. You have something against Connie Francis?

CORNY
The kids are just over the moon for rhythm and blues, Velma. They can't get enough.

...

VELMA
Ah, ah, ah! None of that! Save your personal lives for the camera! And we're back in five... four... three...

The lights change to indicate we're back on the air

CORNY
Now don't forget, guys and Gidgets — our very first primetime spectacular is coming up on June 6th. We'll be live at Baltimore's brand-new Eventorium broadcasting nationwide! Talent scouts will be on hand from all of the major record labels, and sponsoring the event will be none other than our own ULTRA CLUTCH HAIRSPRAY. So, let's give a great big fawning Baltimore salute to the President of Ultra Clutch, Harriman F. Spritzer.

SPRITZER
Ultra Clutch is happy to bring you fine youngsters to national attention.

ALL
Our big break!

CORNY
Also, live on the special, we'll be crowning your choice for Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!

...

AMBER
Hey, gang, don't forget to watch mom and me next Thursday on mother daughter day. And I want to be your Miss Teenage Hairspray. Remember, a vote for me from you is a vote for me.

CORNY
What an unexpected ad lib, Amber. And it speaking of expecting the unexpected, our own a fun loving, freewheeling Brenda will be taking a little leave of absence from the show. How long will you be gone, Brenda?

BRENDA
Nine months.

CORNY
So, it seems we'll have an opening for a girl who is just as fun-loving, but maybe not quite as freewheeling. Wanna be one of the nicest kids in town? Cut school tomorrow and come down to station WZZT to audition!

.SCENE 5 - THE MADISON

Patterson Park High School gymnasium. Corny takes the mic.

CORNY
Hey, there, sophomores and sophomores at heart. I'm honored to be your guest DJ here at PPHS. So with no further a do-do, let's do-do some dancing.
(music starts)
It's the hottest dance around and it was born right here in Baltimore. What's it called kids?

STUDENTS
The Madison!

CORNY
And where'd you see it first?

STUDENTS
The Corny Collins Show!

CORNY
Let's form to big strong lines — it's Madison time! Go!

...

SEAWEED
You keep your eye on Corny. This could be your big chance.

TRACY
You better keep an eye on me.

CORNY
Now when I say "Hit it," show me a big, bad Baltimore Box...... hit it!

LITTLE INEZ
How come we always have to dance in the back?

SEAWEED
I don't know. There's them and there's us. That's just the way it is.

CORNY
When I say "hit it," take it to the basket like Wilt the Stilt......hit it!
(to Amber)
Amber, who's your friend? She's like a breath of fresh, mountain air.

AMBER
You got the Mountain part right. Oink-oink.

CORNY
Now when I say "hit it," let's take a drive down Druid Hill....hit it! Hang a right....feed the monkey.....he's in the back seat.

LINK
Hey, little darlin'. Haven't we met somewhere?

TRACY
Ohmigod, Link Larkin just spoke to me. I'll never wash this ear again.

CORNY
When I say "hit it," let's make like Jackie Gleason — hommina, hommina, hommina....hit it!

ALL
And away we go!

TRACY
Hi, Corny!

CORNY
Hey, cupcake. What's your name?

TRACY
I'm Tracy Turnblad.

CORNY
What else have you got hiding in those Buster Browns?

...

AMBER
Everybody stop liking her!!!!

CORNY
OK everybody, let's take it home. Crazy!

The kids do the Madison

CORNY
And that, Baltimorians, is how we do the Madison.

.SCENE 6 - SUCCESS

.NICEST KIDS REPRISE

KIDS
Oh - oo - oo... Hoot hoot hoot hoo-oot

CORNY
Hey there teenage Baltimore. You're just in time for the Corny Collins Show!

SPRITZER
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch!

CORNY
And it tastes good too. Today's jam packed edition will feature Link Larkin singing a special request Top 40 hit "It Takes Two." So, let the party begin!

...

TRACY
And I'm Tracy!

COUNCIL MEMBERS
Whoo!

CORNY & KIDS
So, every night you're shaking
As you lie in bed

And the bass and drums
Are pounding in your head

CORNY
Who cares about sleep
When you can snooze in school?

They'll never get to college
But they sure look cool

Don't need a cap and gown
'Cause they're the
Nicest kids in town

They're the
Nicest, nicest
They're the
Nicest, nicest
They're the
Sugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...
Kids in Town!

CORNY
Yeah! And that was our dance of the week — "Peyton Place After Midnight," introduced to you by our brand-new Council member, Miss Tracy Turnblad.

...

EDNA
She can't hear you.
(the phone rings and she answers it.)
Hello?... Yes. This is her childhood home. No I'm not her father.

CORNY
So let's wave a wistful bye-bye to Brenda — see you next year.

COUNCIL MEMBERS
Awww...

CORNY
...and inaugurate the newest member of our Council, Tracy Turnblad! Cozy up to old Corny and tell us about yourself, Trrrrace.

TRACY
Well, I go to Patterson Park High, I watch your show, and do absolutely nothing else.
(all applaud and cheer)
But someday I hope to be the first woman president of the world or a Rockette. You got to think big to be big!

CORNY
And if you were president, what would your first official act be?

TRACY
Well, I'd make every day Negro Day!

VELMA & SPRITZER
Aaaaaiiieeeeeee!!!!!!

CORNY
I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Trace! What do you say, kids? Looks like we might just have a hot new candidate for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

AMBER
(grabbing the mic)
no, she can't be miss hairspray! She's the before in the Metrecal diet ad, and I'm the after, and afters always win!

CORNY
Amber, what the comedian!
(bonks Amber on the head)
So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?

AMBER
(grabbing the mic)
No! He can't because everyone knows that whenever he sings, he sings to me, he's completely involved with me, see?

CORNY
Right. So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?

TRACY
Would I? Would I?

AMBER
(grabbing the mic)
You people are ignoring the laws of nature!

CORNY
Link Larkin, our own budding Elvis, will now sing to the equally blooming Tracy Turnblad his version of this week's Top 40 hit, "It Takes Two."

...

SPRITZER
Mrs. Von Tussle, Negro Day everyday? That chubby communist girl and kissing on the mouth with possibly parted lips... I assure you, controversy is not what Ultra Clutch wishes to promote.

CORNY
Negroes and chubby girls buy hairspray, too, Mr. Spritzer.

SPRITZER
Mrs. Von Tussle, how do you plan to handle this?

VELMA
I plan to start by firing him!

CORNY
You can't fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collings Show.

VELMA
Why not? They do it all the time on Lassie!

CORNY
Mr. Spritzer, to keep your audience, you got to keep up with the times.

VELMA
This show's fine the way it is.

CORNY
Bringing Tracy on is just beginning. I've got terrific ideas for updating the show.

SPRITZER
I'm getting one of my sick headaches. Is there a place where I might lie down?

VELMA
There's a bed in my office.
(Spritzer leaves)
So you've got ideas, do you? And going behind my back to put this no talent Commie on the show is one of them?

CORNY
Damn right, Velma. It's time we put kids on the show who looks like the kids who watch the show.

VELMA
Not while I'm producing it.

CORNY
I was thinking it might be time to change that, too.

VELMA
Are you threatening me, Collins?

CORNY
Aw, you know me, Velma! On the other hand, I could always take the show to Channel 11.
(Corny exits laughing)

.SCENE 5 - MISS TEENAGE HAIRSPRAY

Drum Roll... Corny appears on stage

CORNY
And now, live, from the certified up-to-code Baltimore Eventorium... For the first time ever on nationwide television... it's The Corny Collins Spectacular...

GIRLS
He's Corny!

CORNY
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray!

What gives a girl
Power and punch?
Is it a charm, is it poise?
No, it's hairspray!

What gets a gal
Asked out to lunch
Is it brains, is it dough?
No, it's hairspray

If you take a ride
With no can at to your side
Then your flip will be gone with the wind

But if you spray it and lock it,
You can take off in a rocket
And in outer space
Each hair will be in place

Why take a chance
When you get up and dance?
If you twist, I insist
You use hairspray

And tell your mother
Her head she should smother
With "Ultra-Clutch" faithfully

So if you're a redhead, a blond or brunette
Just take my advice
And you might just get

The only thing better than hairspray
That's me!

Forget the milk man
The only thing better than hairspray
That's me!

ENSEMBLE
Ah Ah Ah Ah...

CORNY & ENSEMBLE
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
What makes a man
Reach out and touch
Ultra clutch!
So if you're a redhead, a blonde or brunette

CORNY
Just take my advice
And you might just get

The only thing better than hairspray
That's me!

GIRLS
He's Corny Collins!

CORNY
The only thing better than hairspray
That's me

COUNCILLETTES
Ska-doo-dl-e-ya-do-wah

CORNY & THE COUNCILLETTES
Ska-doo-dl-e-doo-wah-do-wah

CORNY
"Hey baby, you look like you could use a stiff one!"

...

VELMA
Get out! And coming back to Corny on camera one in 3...2...

CORNY
And now for the talent portion of the competition where the frontrunner gals present a dance of their own creation.
(looking at the scoreboard)
Presently, it appears Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad are neck and neck. But since, according to the latest police bulletins, Miss Turnblad is still at large...

AMBER
At VERY large.

CORNY
...our Miss Hairspray might just be a foregone conclusion. Still, our rules say contestants have to dance for it. Are you ready, Amber?

...

AMBER
Thank you ladies, gentlemen and kids. I'm now ready to consume the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray.

Corny leads Spritzer on. Spritzer carries the crown and bouquet.

CORNY
Just to be sure, I think we'd better check the board.

SPRITZER
Could we please see the tally?

all turn to the board and amber wins by a few votes

SPRITZER
Yes, Amber Von Tussle just squeaks in as the winner.

AMBER
What did I tell you? Give me the crown, give me the flowers, and everybody start bowing!

TRACY
Not so fast, Amber. Look who's coming in the front door.

CORNY
Right on schedule! I mean, I know nothing about this complex plan. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the never to be counted out Tracy Turnblad.

...

.AFTER: YOU CAN'T STOP THE BEAT

applause

CORNY
Everyone, look... Look at the scoreboard!
(all look)
Tracy Turnblad, I declare you Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!

...

TRACY
Of course you, Link. But I also want a graduate degree in Musicology with a minor in the ethnic studies. And if there's something else I'd like to say - The Corny Collins Show is now and forever more officially integrated!
(Cheers fill the room)

CORNY
America look up! Here's history right before your eyes. Television will never be the same.

...

PRUDY
And you look so happy. I can't say it's what I want, but if this fine looking cat-like black boy is responsible for the light in your eyes, then how could I object?

CORNY
Live television - there's nothing like it.
