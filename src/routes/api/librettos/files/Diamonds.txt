> ACT 1 <

A shape appears on the balcony. the french windows rattle, then open. a darkly dressed figure enters wearing a balaclava over his head hiding his face. he glances cautiously around. does not see the body on the sofa.

JIMMY
(Low voice)
Hello? Anybody here?
(Goes to the bedroom door and peers in)
Hello?

Goes to the suite door, opens it and peers out into the corridor. Leaves the door slightly ajar and returns. Takes off the balaclava and is revealed as a rather gormless looking character in his 30s. stealthily searches around, still without seeing the body. goes to the desk. puts the balaclava on the desk and opens drawers. finds a jewellery box. takes out a diamond necklace. holds it up to inspect it

JIMMY
Aha! Yes!!

Stuffs it into his pocket. moves round the room again. comes across the body and leaps back

JIMMY
Ahhh!
(Peers)
Ohhh!
(Dithers)
Er.... Oh....

Looks around wondering what to do. reaches forward to check if the body is really dead. at that moment the suite door is pushed open and adam bursts in. good looking actor type

JIMMY
(Jumping back)
Ahhhh!

ADAM
Ahh!
(Sees the body)
Ohhhh!
(Rushes forward and checks the body)
You.... you bastard!

JIMMY
Me? No, no....

ADAM
You’ve killed her!

JIMMY
No, no–not me.

ADAM
You swine! She told me!

JIMMY
What?

ADAM
She rang my mobile, you bastard! She told me you were trying to kill her!

JIMMY
No, no, not me!

ADAM
Don’t try and deny it – look at you! Caught in the act!

He punches jimmy on the jaw and knocks him out cold

(... 6 pages of dialog ...)

ADAM
On the day of her premiere! Bastard!

JIMMY STIRS AND SITS UP

ADAM
Don’t you move!

JIMMY
(DAZED)
What’s happened?

ADAM
You’ve been rumbled, chum, that’s what’s happened. You’ve been caught red-handed at murder, and your mistress is implicated too!

JIMMY
(BEWILDERED)
My mistress?

( ... )

GRACE
(INDICATING THE LUNCH TRAY)
He must have put some in my lunch.

ADAM
Proof! The bastard!

THREATENS JIMMY AGAIN, WHO COWERS AWAY

JIMMY
No, no.

ADAM
(TO OSCAR)
Call the police. We must have him arrested.

OSCAR
Er.... yes.

JIMMY
No, please....

ADAM
But we can’t just let him go. He tried to murder her!

JIMMY
No, no, I....

ADAM
And his mistress was in on it.

GRACE
His mistress?

ADAM
You were right. She tried to stop him. ‘H’.

GRACE
H?

JIMMY
H?

ADAM
Check your phone. How can you deny it?

JIMMY
(LOOKS AT HIS PHONE)
I, er....

ADAM
Well? More proof!

JIMMY
That’s not... it’s just... I mean... I didn’t do anything.

ADAM
Didn’t do anything? You fed her peanuts! Knowing they were lethal for her.

JIMMY
No, I didn’t. It wasn’t me.

ADAM
I caught you. Standing right over her.

GRACE
You did?

ADAM
Yes.
(TO HIM)
Minutes after you called me.

JIMMY
Yes, but I... I....

ADAM
You were the only other person in the apartment. What were you doing if you weren’t trying to kill her?

GRACE
Yes, what were you doing?

OSCAR
Yes, what were you doing?

JIMMY
(AT A LOSS)
I was, um.... I was just....

ADAM
What? What?

JIMMY
Trying to save her.

( ... )

GRACE
Help me up....

ADAM HELPS HER TO STAND UNSTEADILY

GRACE
Now let me get this straight.
(POINTS AT JIMMY)
This is my secretive husband who supposedly was trying to poison me....

JIMMY
No, no....

( ... )

OSCAR
More or less.

GRACE
Intriguing.
(TURNS TO JIMMY)
And what was his motive for trying to murder me?

JIMMY
I didn’t.... I wasn’t....

ADAM
He claimed you had a lover.

GRACE
Really?

JIMMY
No, I didn’t!

( ... )

GRACE
Not you. You’re my agent.
(POINTS AT JIMMY)
With him.

JIMMY
Me?

( ... )

GRACE
Out, out!

HAILEY HESITATES LOOKING AT JIMMY

HAILEY
Um....

GRACE
You too, sweetheart. You’ve delivered your non- message – thank you very much. Go and discuss press relations with my agent.

THEY ALL LEAVE RELUCTANTLY. SHE TURNS TO FACE JIMMY

JIMMY
Oh dear.

GRACE
Right, whoever you are – enlighten me as to what has happened here.

JIMMY
Oh God.

GRACE
No, he won’t help. In fact you may well feel his wrath if you can’t explain why you are posing as my husband who apparently tried to murder me.

JIMMY
I didn’t, I promise.

GRACE
Pose as my husband, or try to murder me?

JIMMY
Either – both. I didn’t.

GRACE
No, I don’t think you did, but everyone else seems to think you did – so what’s it all about?

JIMMY
I, er.... It’s rather hard to explain.

GRACE
Then let me take a guess. I know exactly who you are.

JIMMY
(APPREHENSIVE)
You do?

GRACE
You’re the paparazzi.

JIMMY
Paparazzi?

GRACE
Think I can’t recognise a hack when I see one? I’ve had to put up with you lot dogging me all my life. Didn’t follow all the others to the Carlton, but came here instead, didn’t you? Well?

JIMMY
(SEEING A GLIMMER OF HOPE)
Er.... that’s right.

GRACE
After a cheap story, aren’t you? Sensational Cannes Festival scoop. What a nerve! How did you get into my suite?

JIMMY
I, er.... the door was unlocked.

GRACE
Was it indeed? Interesting. So you thought you’d just wander in and sniff around, eh? Thought you might have yourself an exclusive.

JIMMY
(APOLOGETIC)
That’s right. I....

GRACE
Well you certainly stumbled on one, didn’t you? Discovered a star’s dead body on the sofa. Scoop of the year! Except I wasn’t quite dead.

JIMMY
Yes. I....

GRACE
Then what happened? Everyone arrived and you were caught with your pants down?

JIMMY
Well not exactly....

GRACE
And my leading man mistook you for my husband.

JIMMY
Yes. Then your agent arrived....

GRACE
He’s not my agent - he’s my real husband, you fool.

JIMMY
Ah.

GRACE
And my incompetent manager, not my agent. There’s a big difference.

JIMMY
(BEWILDERED)
Right. So why did he....?

GRACE
Not admit to being my husband? That’s what I want to find out. Did he in fact try to poison me? Has he got a mistress? Is it that bimbo who just arrived?

JIMMY
Oh, I don’t think so.

GRACE
How would you know?

JIMMY
Well she.... I mean.... she doesn’t look the sort.

GRACE
On the contrary, she looks exactly the sort.

JIMMY
No, no....

GRACE
Why are you defending her?

JIMMY
Well, I just... I....

GRACE
One hell of a headline you’ve got unravelling here, haven’t you, chum? Which rag do you work for?

JIMMY
I, er.... I’m freelance.

GRACE
Well I’ll tell you what, Mr er.... What’s your name?

JIMMY
J... just call me Jimmy.

GRACE
Right, Jimmy. Here’s the deal. You use your journalistic skills – otherwise known as nose for dirt – to find out what my husband is up to, and I’ll refrain from having you prosecuted for breaking and entering, invasion of privacy, attempted murder, and whatever else my lawyers can think of. How does that sound?

JIMMY
How do I do that?

GRACE
How do you usually do it? You people must glean at least a faint semblance of fact on which you base your fairy stories. Snoop around. Dig up the dirt. Sniff out the scandal. BUT... you bring it to me before you give it to any of the papers. Understood?

JIMMY
Right.

GRACE
(PACING)
Meanwhile I have to think how I’m going to play things from now on. If my husband did try to poison me....

JIMMY
Why would he do that? A wonderful woman like you.

GRACE
Oh thank you. Well he doesn’t think I’m such a wonderful woman.

JIMMY
Why not?

GRACE
Familiarity breeds contempt – both ways.

JIMMY
Oh.

GRACE
He also knows I’m worth a lot of money, which currently all goes to him on my demise.

JIMMY
Ah.

GRACE
He also knows I’m allergic to peanuts. He also, I suspect, has a mistress who he’d very much like to shack up with.

JIMMY
Oh dear...

GRACE
And that piece of hot totty posing as a secretary is a very likely candidate.

JIMMY
No, no – I don’t think it’s her.

GRACE
What do you know about such things? You look as if you’ve just learnt about the birds and the bees.

JIMMY
Well, I... Is that why he came back to the hotel? In case the press discovered you were dead?

GRACE
Possibly. Or to catch me with my lover.

JIMMY
Ah. Yes, he told me he thought you had a lover.

GRACE
Did he indeed? The pot calling the kettle black.

JIMMY
So that actor guy isn’t?

GRACE
Isn’t what?

JIMMY
Your lover.

GRACE
Of course he is.

JIMMY
Eh?

GRACE
Actresses always have affairs with their leading men. It’s obligatory.

JIMMY
Wow. You show biz people!

GRACE
Don’t be silly. We’re no worse than anyone else. We just make more of a song and dance about it. Now – our problem is, how to explain your presence here, and how to get you access to my husband’s affairs without giving away what you’re up to.

JIMMY
Ah.

GRACE
If he finds out you’re a cheap hack he’ll have you for dinner.

JIMMY
Oh God.

GRACE
I know!

JIMMY
What?

GRACE
We’ll say the film company has taken you on to handle my publicity during the festival, and he has to find room for you in his production office. Perfect!

JIMMY
Publicity?

GRACE
It explains why you’re here, and you’ll be able to snoop around without anyone suspecting.

JIMMY
I don’t know anything about publicity.

GRACE
You know about newspapers, don’t you? Pretend to make some phone calls. Chat to your friends on the magazines. He’ll be glad to have you.

JIMMY
I don’t really think....

GRACE
Listen, sonny, you don’t have any choice in the matter. If you want to stay out of the clutches of the French police you’ll do what I want.

JIMMY
Well....

GRACE
And if you find out what my other half’s really up to then I’ll give you the scoop of your life. ‘Grace Gervaise’s husband arrested for attempted murder, fraud, bigamy, assault, and whatever else we can think of!

JIMMY
Has he done all those things?

GRACE
Who knows? That arsehole’s capable of anything.

JIMMY
I don’t understand how he could treat you like that.

( ... )

OSCAR
You see! Resorting to toy-boys now!

MARCHES TO JIMMY AND KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH A PUNCH.

JIMMY
(JIMMY COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AGAIN)

( ... )

GRACE
What – you mean apart from being my lover who’s pretending to be my husband, who was trying to murder me?

OSCAR
Oh, for God’s sake....!

JIMMY
(JIMMY GROANS AND WAKES UP)

GRACE
Poor Jimmy – are you all right?

ADAM
Well who is he?

OSCAR
Yes, who is he?

GRACE
If you really want to know, he’s....

OSCAR
No! None of your stories - I want to hear it from him.

JIMMY SITS UP RUBBING HIS JAW

JIMMY
I’m getting rather tired of this.

OSCAR
(LEANING OVER HIM)
Who are you and why were you canoodling with my wife?

JIMMY
I thought she was supposed to be my wife.

OSCAR
(THREATENING HIM AGAIN)
Don’t get clever with me! Well?

JIMMY
(JIMMY LOOKS AT GRACE, WHO SIGNALS FOR HIM TO SPEAK)
I’m, er... I’m her new publicity agent.

GRACE
That’s right.

OSCAR
What?

GRACE
The production company assigned him to look after me.

OSCAR
A
(JUST AS JIMMY REACHES THE DOORWAY GRACE SEES HIM)

Grace: Oh look, it’s our little paparazzi man! Following us around, are you, Jimmy boy?

(JIMMY IS CAUGHT IN THE DOORWAY AS IF HE HAS JUST ARRIVED.  SHE WAVES HIM IN)

Come in and join the party. We’re celebrating!

> Jimmy: Er....

Oscar: The film is a success!

Adam: The performance of Grace’s life!

Grace: Yes!

Adam: And mine too of course.

> Jimmy: (HESITATING IN THE DOORWAY)  Oh, good.

Grace: There’s your story, paparazzi man. Tell the world!

Adam: Write the headlines!

Grace: Come in, come in! Rescue your wife from my husband’s lecherous clutches.

> Jimmy: Well, er.....

(HE HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND HIS BACK AND COMES BACK INTO THE ROOM)

( ... )

Grace: To hell with the lot of them! What do they know?

> Jimmy: (HAILEY IS SIGNALLING QUESTIONS TO JIMMY. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND GESTURES HOPELESSLY. HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND A SOFA CUSHION.)

( ... )

Grace: Why did you remind me? My beautiful necklace!

> Jimmy: You, er... still haven’t found it?

( ... )

Grace: Have you written the story yet, Jimmy?

> Jimmy: The story?

Grace: The story of my attempted poisoning by my worthless husband.

Oscar: Oh for God’s sake!

Grace: I thought it might be on tomorrow’s front pages.

> Jimmy: Er, no, not yet.

Grace: Why not?

> Jimmy: I didn’t think you’d want it to, er....

( ... )

Boniface: Yours also I am sure, monsieur. What a night! What an honour for the Hotel Superb!

(POURS CHAMPAGNE AND HANDS ROUND GLASSES.)

> Jimmy: (JIMMY ASSISTS. OSCAR PASSES ONE TO ADAM. SOME CONFUSION OVER GLASSES AS EVERYONE IS INVOLVED)

Boniface: Success after all the dramas, all the crises.  Let us drink to another triumph for Madame Gervaise, doyen of the cinema.

Oscar: If we must.

Boniface: And to her brilliant manager of course.

Grace: If we have to.

Boniface: (RAISES GLASS) The Gervaises!

> All: (RAISING GLASSES)  The Gervaises!

( ... )

Boniface: (MODESTLY)  Well actually the genius was my chambermaid.  She found it in the waste bin.

> Jimmy: (IN DISGUST)  Ah!

( ... )

Adam: Perhaps he was the murderer.

Oscar: Would-be murderer.

Boniface: Perhaps.  Who knows?

> Jimmy: No!

Boniface: What?

> Jimmy: Why would he...? I mean, what would he...?  I mean, why would he try to murder someone before stealing their jewellery?

Hailey: That’s a good point.

( ... )

Boniface: Madame, monsieur! This is not the way for imminent show business people to behave. Especially in front of the press.

> Jimmy: No, quite.

( ... )

Grace: (POINTING AT OSCAR) You! You were handing out the glasses.

Oscar: No!  (POINTING AT JIMMY)  Him!  He was helping.

> Jimmy: No, no, not me!

Boniface: We cannot leave him on the floor.  Carry him to the bedroom while I call the doctor.

Grace: Yes, yes – put him on the bed.

> Jimmy: (OSCAR AND JIMMY CARRY THE BODY INTO THE BEDROOM WITH HAILEY IN ATTENDANCE, AS BONIFACE SPEAKS ON THE HOTEL PHONE. ONLY GRACE IS WITH HIM)

( ... )

Grace: You despicable man! You pathetic lecher! You jealous hypocrite! You’ve murdered the love of my life!

Oscar: No! No!

(SHE FIRES TWICE. OSCAR CRUMBLES TO THE FLOOR. BONIFACE STARES AGHAST.)

> Jimmy:  (JIMMY AND HAILEY RUN IN)

Boniface: Ah, mon dieu!

Hailey: What happened?

Boniface: She has shot him! She has killed her husband!

> Jimmy: (GOING TO OSCAR) Oh my God! (TO GRACE) What have you done?

Grace: Now you’ve got a real story, paparazzi man. It’s your lucky day. Two celebrity murders to write about.

Boniface: But Madame, what were you thinking?

Grace: He deserved it. He had it coming. He poisoned my leading man – out of pure jealousy!

> Jimmy: You don’t know it was him.

( ... )

Boniface: Uh! Such theatrics. (WIPES HIS BROW) I don’t know if I’m going or coming. My head is spinning. (WAVES AT THE PHONE) Someone please tell reception to stop the doctor coming. We don’t want any more witnesses to this fiasco!

Hailey: I’ll do it.

> Jimmy: (HAILEY GOES TO SPEAK ON THE PHONE. ON THE WAY SHE SIGNALS TO JIMMY AND POINTS AT THE NECKLACE ON THE TABLE WHERE GRACE HAS LEFT IT)

Boniface: (APOLOGETIC) I did not say because I was still trying to solve the rest of the mystery. I was trying to discover which of you crazy peoples was where and who knew what and who did what to who. I am sorry.

> Jimmy: (HAILEY PUTS DOWN THE PHONE. JIMMY HAS STEALTHILY MOVED CLOSE TO NECKLACE. HE SIGNALS TO HER)

( ... )

Boniface: Don’t be absurd, monsieur! There isn’t enough poison in France for another one!

> Jimmy: (AS THEY CROWD ROUND HAILEY, JIMMY QUIETLY GRABS THE NECKLACE, NIPS TO THE FRENCH WINDOWS, OPENS THEM, HOOKS THE NECKLACE ONTO THE OUTER HANDLE, AND CLOSES THEM AGAIN. THEN HE RETURNS TO HAILEY)

Boniface: Ma’mselle, can you hear me? Ma’amselle bimbo?

Grace: Get the doctor back.

> Jimmy: No, it’s all right. Keep back please, everyone.

Boniface: What?

> Jimmy: I know what’s wrong.

Grace: You do?

> Jimmy: It’s a panic attack.

Boniface: Panic attack?

> Jimmy: (KNEELING BESIDE HER)  She gets them sometimes.

It’s all the excitement.

(HE PATS HER CHEEKS)

Wake up, Hailey, wake up.  It’s all right.  I’m here.

(HE MASSAGES HER HANDS)

Wake up.

Hailey: (STIRRING) Oh! (SITS UP) What happened?

> Jimmy: You’ve drunk too much. You’ve had one of your attacks. But it’s all right.

Hailey: (WEAK VOICE)  So many murders... and guns.... and poisons....

> Jimmy: Yes, but nobody’s died.  We’re all here. Everything’s all right.

Hailey: You promise?

> Jimmy: Yes, yes.

Oscar: This is beyond a joke!

Adam: Hear, hear.

Boniface: I agree, monsieur. Does anyone else wish to pass out before we continue? Heart attach perhaps? Brain seizure anyone?

> Jimmy: I’m so sorry. She’s all right now. Aren't you , Hailey?

(HE HELPS HER GET TO HER FEET)

Hailey: Yes, yes, I’m fine.

> Jimmy: It won’t happen again.

( ... )

Boniface: The waste bin.  (UPENDS IT)  Nothing.

Grace: (POINTING AT JIMMY AND HAILEY)  You two!  It must have been you two.

> Jimmy: Us?  How?

Hailey: I was unconscious.

> Jimmy: I was attending to her.

Boniface: (SHRUGGING) They are so clever these Riviera thieves. They have such tricks. Maybe this time they somehow.... What do you think, Mr Paparazzi man?

> Jimmy: It’s a mystery.  What do you think, Hailey?

( ... )

Grace: (OFFHAND)  It doesn’t really matter.  It wasn’t worth anything anyway.

Oscar: What do you mean?

Grace: It wasn’t the real necklace.  It was a replica.

> Jimmy: What?

Hailey: What?

Grace: I never wear the real thing – it’s too valuable.

Boniface: It wasn’t...!  Where is the real one?

Grace: In your hotel safe, Monsieur Boniface.  Where I trust it’s really safe.  Unless your chef has access to it.

> Jimmy: (GASPS OF INCREDULITY ALL ROUND. JIMMY AND HAILEY ROLL EYES AT EACH OTHER)

( ... )

Adam: (UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) All right. Oscar, tell the company what you did when I collapsed?

> Jimmy: (WHILE THE FOCUS IS ON OSCAR, JIMMY SIGNALS TO HAILEY, WHO EDGES TOWARDS THE FRENCH WINDOWS)

( ... )

Grace: All right. Now the paparazzi man and his bimbo.

Hailey: Ohh!

> Jimmy: Please stop calling my wife a bimbo.

Grace: Sorry. The paparazzi man and his totty.

Hailey: Uh!

Adam: (TO JIMMY) Well? What were your movements?

> Jimmy: (INDICATING OSCAR) Well, the same as his. We helped carry you in there. We didn’t come back until the shots.

Grace: Ah, but then what?

> Jimmy: Well, we.... we....

( ... )

Grace: I think little Jimmy and his pretty partner can tell us.

(EVERYONE STARES AT THE PAIR)

Boniface: Eh?

Oscar: What?

> Jimmy: Us?

Grace: Yes, you, you pseudo paparazzi man. You clever pair of innocents. You’re no journalist. She’s no secretary. You’re the Riviera jewel thieves, aren’t you?

Hailey: Us?

Grace: You think you can pull the wool over my eyes? Me, the expert on every convoluted film plot ever written? The star of half the crime melodramas ever made? I rumbled you two the moment you met here.

Boniface: Is this true?  You are the Riviera jewel thieves?

> Jimmy: (BASHFUL) Well.... I suppose there’s no point in denying it now.

Oscar: Good God!

Adam: Bloody hell!

Grace: Leaving my necklace in the waste bin – really!

> Jimmy: (SHRUGGING)  There was nowhere else.

Grace: (TO HAILEY) That pathetic stage faint – huh!

Hailey: It fooled all of them.

Grace: I’ve seen better ones in a Punch and Judy show. Tell me, are you two actually married?

Hailey: No.

> Jimmy: We’re just partners.

( ... )

Grace: (TO THEM)  Replaced it after I told you it wasn’t worth anything, didn’t you?

(THEY SHRUG)

Very neat.  However, a big mistake.

> Jimmy: Why?

Grace: I was lying. It is in fact the real one.

Hailey: What??

Grace: I decided I wanted the real thing for the premiere tonight, so I asked the receptionist to take it from the hotel safe this morning and leave the fake one in its place.

> Jimmy: Uh...

( ... )

Adam: (CLAPPING) Hurrah! All friends again.

> Jimmy: (JIMMY AND HAILEY JOIN IN THE APPLAUSE.)
