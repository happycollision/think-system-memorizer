# Bride Wars Scene

Liv: You sent out your save-the-dates?

> Emma: Yeah, I did, actually.

Liv: Uh...

> Emma: Surprised?

Liv: So one of us... Is not moving her date?

> Emma: Well, you amaze me, Liv. You really do. You-You never ask me what I want. You just figure you know best, end of story. "Emma, wear this. Emma, say that." Well, Emma's pretty frickin' tired of it.

Liv: Oh, whoa.

> Emma: Don't think I didn't notice how totally freaked out you were because I had the nerve to get engaged before you did.

Liv: Okay, wait! First of all, Daniel bought that ring in December. Okay? So officially, I was first.

> Emma: Oh, pathetic. Pathetic!

Liv: Second, people always make you do things you don't wanna do. Emma, it's like you don't have a spine. Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have a spine.

> Emma: Wow. No one could accuse you of being soft, Liv. You grabbed the first date in June Marion offered... without even asking me first.

Liv: At least I'm not so terrified of being alone...that I people-please my way through life. Emma, you settle.

> Emma: Are you saying that I'm settling with Fletcher?

Liv: I wasn't thinking about Fletcher. You came up with that one on your own.

> Emma: Ooh. Move your date, Liv.

Liv: You move your date, Emma.

> Emma: It's done. You lose.

Liv: Your wedding better watch it.

> Emma: What did you just say?

Liv: I said your wedding should be very scared right now. If I were your wedding, I'd sleep with one eye open.

> Emma: Why don't you just save your threats for Daniel? After all, isn't that how you got a proposal out of him?

Liv: Your wedding can suck it.

> Emma: What did you just say? My wedding can suck it?

Liv: I said your wedding can suck it.

> Emma: Your wedding can s... be... I mean, yours can be, um... Can-Can be, uh...

Liv: Bye, ladies.

> Emma: Hey, Liv.

Liv: Yes.

> Emma: Your wedding will be huge. Just like your ass at prom.

Liv: We're done.

> Emma: So Done.

Liv: Hmm. Good.
