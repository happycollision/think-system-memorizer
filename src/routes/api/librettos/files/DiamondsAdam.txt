> ACT 1 <

JIMMY
Aha! Yes!!

Stuffs it into his pocket. moves round the room again. comes across the body and leaps back

JIMMY
Ahhh!
(Peers)
Ohhh!
(Dithers)
Er.... Oh....

Looks around wondering what to do. reaches forward to check if the body is really dead. at that moment the suite door is pushed open and adam bursts in. good looking actor type

JIMMY
(Jumping back)
Ahhhh!

ADAM
Ahh!
(Sees the body)
Ohhhh!
(Rushes forward and checks the body)
You.... you bastard!

JIMMY
Me? No, no....

ADAM
You've killed her!

JIMMY
No, no–not me.

ADAM
You swine! She told me!

JIMMY
What?

ADAM
She rang my mobile, you bastard! She told me you were trying to kill her!

JIMMY
No, no, not me!

ADAM
Don't try and deny it – look at you! Caught in the act!

He punches jimmy on the jaw and knocks him out cold

ADAM
Bastard!

GOES TO THE BODY AND KNEELS BESIDE IT

ADAM
My darling.... What has he done to you? Speak to me. Oh my God, she's dead!

OSCAR APPEARS IN THE OPEN DOORWAY. SLEEK BUSINESS TYPE

OSCAR
Hey!

ADAM
(LEAPING UP)
Oh!

OSCAR
What the....? What's going on?

ADAM
Who are you?

OSCAR
I'm.... Who are you?

ADAM
I'm.... er....

OSCAR
(SEEING THE BODY)
Oh my God! What's happened?

ADAM
It's Grace Gervaise. She's dead. She's been murdered.

OSCAR
Murdered?

ADAM
By her husband.

A BEAT

OSCAR
Her husband?

ADAM
Yes.
(POINTS AT JIMMY)
There.

OSCAR
That's her husband?

ADAM
Yes.

OSCAR
Is he dead too?

ADAM
No. I just punched him.

OSCAR
(DITHERING)
Why? What? Who....? I don't understand.

ADAM
I got a desperate call on my mobile. She said her husband was trying to kill her. And I rushed over and found her like this.

OSCAR
Kill her – how?

ADAM
Poison, she said.

OSCAR
Poison?

ADAM
Yes.

OSCAR
She said her husband?

ADAM
Well someone. Most likely her husband. They detest each other.

OSCAR
Do they?
(ADAM NODS)
And.... that's her husband?

ADAM
Yes. He was standing right over her. I've never met him, but I know he's a shit.

OSCAR
(INDIGNANT)
A shit! Who told you that?

ADAM
She did.

OSCAR
Who are you?

ADAM
I'm.... er....

OSCAR
I know you! You're that actor. In her film.

ADAM
Er... yes.

OSCAR
(CAUTIOUSLY)
Of course! So you must be....

ADAM
Who are *you*?

OSCAR
Me?

ADAM
Yes.

OSCAR
I'm, er....

ADAM
Yes?

OSCAR
Her agent.

ADAM
Her agent?

OSCAR
Yes.

ADAM
Ah! You're
here for the premiere?

OSCAR
Exactly. I
just came round to, er.... Tell me....

ADAM
What?

OSCAR
Why did she
call you?

ADAM
Well, I.... she.... I was the first person she thought of.

OSCAR
Why?

ADAM
Well I was working with her. I'm in the next hotel....

OSCAR
The Carlton?

ADAM
Yes. I rushed straight over.

OSCAR
(FIERCE)
You're her lover, aren't you?

ADAM
What?

OSCAR
I know she has a lover. You're him.

ADAM
Nonsense! I'm just a friend. Working with her.

OSCAR
Well if you aren't....
(TURNS TO JIMMY)
He must be.

ADAM
That's her husband.

OSCAR
Ah, yes.
(TURNS BACK)
Then it has to be you.

ADAM
Me what?

OSCAR
Her lover.

ADAM
No, I told you, I.... How do you know she has a lover?

OSCAR
I just know.

ADAM
What's it to you anyway?

OSCAR
What?

ADAM
You're just her agent.

OSCAR
Yes, well.... I have to protect my assets.

ADAM
You haven't protected her very well.
(GOES TO THE BODY)
Oh, poor Grace....
(TURNS ON JIMMY)
You bastard!

KICKS HIM. JIMMY GROANS AND STIRS

OSCAR
You're sure that's her husband?

ADAM
Who else could it be? Grace was afraid he'd try something.

OSCAR
How do you know?

ADAM
She told me. Bastard!
(KICKS JIMMY AGAIN)

OSCAR
Steady on. Don't kill him.

ADAM
We must call the police.

OSCAR
(HESITATING)
Ah. Well, er....

ADAM
Or perhaps the management.

OSCAR
Yes. Er.... Hang on a moment....
(THINKS)

ADAM
What are you waiting for? We must do something!

OSCAR
Yes, but....

ADAM
That's his phone!
(GOES TO JIMMY AND TAKES HIS MOBILE FROM HIS POCKET)
Message. 'Don't do it. Leave now.' There! Proof!

OSCAR
Who's it from?

ADAM
'H'. Who's H?

OSCAR
I don't know.

ADAM
I can guess.

OSCAR
Who?

ADAM
Someone who was in on the plot. His mistress!

OSCAR
His mistress?

ADAM
He has a mistress. She told me.

OSCAR
She told you that?

ADAM
Yes.

OSCAR
She told you an awful lot.

ADAM
Well we've been working together. Closely.

OSCAR
Very closely. How did she know?

ADAM
What?

OSCAR
That her husband has a mistress!

ADAM
She suspected. Bastard! A wonderful woman like Grace. That's his motive of course.

OSCAR
'Don't do it – leave now.' Why would his mistress send a message like that?

ADAM
I dunno. Perhaps they planned it together.

OSCAR
Her murder?

ADAM
They planned to kill Grace and run off together. Then perhaps she got cold feet. She was telling him not to kill Grace, but just to leave her now.

OSCAR
Leave her?

ADAM
On the day of her premiere! *Bastard*!

JIMMY STIRS AND SITS UP

ADAM
Don't you move!

JIMMY
(DAZED)
What's happened?

ADAM
You've been rumbled, chum, that's what's happened. You've been caught red-handed at murder, and your mistress is implicated too!

JIMMY
(BEWILDERED)
My mistress?

ADAM
How could you? A fabulous woman like Grace! Murdered!

OSCAR
Are you sure she's dead?

ADAM
Of course she is.
(GOES TO THE BODY)
She was already passing out when she phoned me, and....

FEELS HER PULSE. SHE STIRS AND MOANS. HE LEAPS BACK

ADAM
Oh my God!

OSCAR
Oh my God!

ADAM
Grace?

GRACE
(PAUSE. SHE SITS UP GROGGILY. NOT YOUNG BUT STILL GLAMOROUS FILM STAR)
(DAZED)
What happened?

ADAM
Grace! You're not dead!

GRACE
I don't think so.
(LOOKS UP)
Adam! What are you...?

ADAM
You called me.

GRACE
Oh yes. I....
(SEES OSCAR AND JUMPS)
Ah!

OSCAR
Grace.

GRACE
Why are you....?
(SEES JIMMY AND JUMPS AGAIN)
Ah!!

ADAM
It's all right. I caught him.

GRACE
Caught who?

ADAM
(INDICATING JIMMY)
Your husband. Red-handed.

GRACE
My husband?

ADAM
Yes.
(INDICATING OSCAR)
And he's a witness - your agent.

GRACE
My agent?

ADAM
We'll put him away for life!

GRACE
(FROWNING)
I, er....

ADAM
How are you feeling?

GRACE
All right, I think. I must have collapsed.
(WAVERS BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO)
Who, er....? Why, er....?

ADAM
Take it easy. You're confused.

GRACE
I'm not sure what's happened here.

ADAM
Someone tried to poison you – your husband probably - and you called me before you passed out.

GRACE
Ah, yes.

ADAM
How did he do it?

GRACE
Do it?

ADAM
Poison you.

GRACE
Peanuts.

ADAM
Peanuts?

GRACE
He knows I'm allergic.

ADAM
Ah, yes.

GRACE
(INDICATING THE LUNCH TRAY)
He must have put some in my lunch.

ADAM
Proof! The bastard!

THREATENS JIMMY AGAIN, WHO COWERS AWAY

JIMMY
No, no.

ADAM
(TO OSCAR)
Call the police. We must have him arrested.

OSCAR
Er.... yes.

JIMMY
No, please....

ADAM
Caught in the act. You'll get life for this!

GRACE
Just a minute.

ADAM
What?

GRACE
Let's think about it.

ADAM
What's there to think about? It's attempted murder. We're all witnesses.

GRACE
Yes, but er.... Well, is it wise?

ADAM
Wise?

GRACE
The publicity....

ADAM
Ah.

OSCAR
Yes, quite! The publicity.

GRACE
The middle of the Cannes Film Festival...

OSCAR
Grace all over the headlines.

ADAM
Yes.

OSCAR
Not a good idea.

ADAM
But we can't just let him go. He tried to murder her!

JIMMY
No, no, I....

ADAM
And his mistress was in on it.

GRACE
His mistress?

ADAM
You were right. She tried to stop him. 'H'.

GRACE
H?

JIMMY
H?

ADAM
Check your phone. How can you deny it?

JIMMY
(LOOKS AT HIS PHONE)
I, er....

ADAM
Well? More proof!

JIMMY
That's not... it's just... I mean... I didn't do anything.

ADAM
Didn't do anything? You fed her peanuts! Knowing they were lethal for her.

JIMMY
No, I didn't. It wasn't me.

ADAM
I caught you. Standing right over her.

GRACE
You did?

ADAM
Yes.
(TO HIM)
Minutes after you called me.

JIMMY
Yes, but I... I....

ADAM
You were the only other person in the apartment. What were you doing if you weren't trying to kill her?

GRACE
Yes, what were you doing?

OSCAR
Yes, what were you doing?

JIMMY
(AT A LOSS)
I was, um.... I was just....

ADAM
What? What?

JIMMY
Trying to save her.

ADAM
Don't give me that! She phoned me on the point of collapse. You were trying to poison her with crushed peanuts or peanut oil, or....
(POINTS AT THE TRAY)
The forensics will find it and you'll be hung, drawn and quartered!

OSCAR
You seem very concerned for someone who's just a fellow actor.

ADAM
Of course! She nearly died.

GRACE
At least someone's concerned.

ADAM
Quite. You're her agent – aren't you concerned?

OSCAR
Well naturally. But she's all right now. It can't have been a very serious attempt.

GRACE
Oh, thank you very much. That's all right then.

OSCAR
No, I didn't mean...

GRACE
Help me up....

ADAM HELPS HER TO STAND UNSTEADILY

GRACE
Now let me get this straight.
(POINTS AT JIMMY)
This is my secretive husband who supposedly was trying to poison me....

JIMMY
No, no....

ADAM
You told me he was.

GRACE
(POINTING AT OSCAR)
And this is my aspiring agent...

ADAM
Aspiring?

GRACE
...who miraculously arrived on the scene at the same time.

OSCAR
Not quite.

GRACE
And who apparently corroborates your story.

ADAM
(TO OSCAR)
Well you do, don't you?

OSCAR
(HESITATING)
Er....

GRACE
Well?

OSCAR
More or less.

GRACE
Intriguing.
(TURNS TO JIMMY)
And what was his motive for trying to murder me?

JIMMY
I didn't.... I wasn't....

ADAM
He claimed you had a lover.

GRACE
Really?

JIMMY
No, I didn't!

ADAM
No.
(POINTS AT OSCAR)
He claimed you had a lover.

( ... )

GRACE
Don't tell me you haven't had lovers.

OSCAR
That's different, I....

GRACE
Oh, I see – one rule for agents and another for clients!

OSCAR
Not at all. I....

ADAM
I don't quite understand. Something odd is going on here....

OSCAR
You'd better keep quiet, you.

GRACE
He's every right to speak.

OSCAR
What – as both your leading man and stand-in at the same time, eh?

GRACE
He's nothing of the sort, and it's nothing to do with my agent anyway.

OSCAR
(CONTAINING HIMSELF)
Grrrr!

GRACE
If you want to remain my agent you'd better stay out of this.

ADAM
Yes, quite.

( ... )

HAILEY
I put them off the trail.
(POINTING TO ADAM)
I sent them to his hotel instead.

ADAM
(PREENING)
Oh thank you.

GRACE
Not you. You're my agent.
(POINTS AT JIMMY)
With him.

JIMMY
Me?

GRACE
Would the rest of you kindly go next door to the bedroom and do whatever you like to do in bedrooms, while I and my 'husband' have a talk. You can discuss the situation and pretend it's all part of Murder In The Dark.

THEY ALL STARE AT HER

GRACE
Go on – shoo!

ADAM
Grace, I....

GRACE
Out.

OSCAR
Look here, Grace....

GRACE
Out, out!

HAILEY HESITATES LOOKING AT JIMMY

HAILEY
Um....

GRACE
You too, sweetheart. You've delivered your non- message – thank you very much. Go and discuss press relations with my agent.

ALL
(THEY ALL LEAVE RELUCTANTLY. SHE TURNS TO FACE JIMMY)

( ... )

OSCAR
You see! Resorting to toy-boys now!

MARCHES TO JIMMY AND KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH A PUNCH. JIMMY COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AGAIN

GRACE
Oh, poor boy!

OSCAR
Hah!

ADAM ENTERS

ADAM
What's happening?

OSCAR
I caught them – practically having it off!

ADAM
What??

OSCAR
He's her lover. I knew all along!

ADAM
I thought he was her husband?

OSCAR
Don't be fatuous – of course he's not. I am.

ADAM
You? But I thought....

GRACE
(TENDING TO JIMMY)
Oh shut up, both of you!

ADAM
I don't understand. This man's your lover?

OSCAR
Yes! Putting your nose out of joint, eh?

ADAM
(TO OSCAR)
And you're her...?

OSCAR
Yes, yes – her very long, very suffering husband. Now shut up!

GRACE
You clowns! The poor boy should have you both for grievous bodily harm!

OSCAR
So what is he doing here?

GRACE
What – you mean apart from being my lover who's pretending to be my husband, who was trying to murder me?

OSCAR
Oh, for God's sake....!

JIMMY GROANS AND WAKES UP

GRACE
Poor Jimmy – are you all right?

ADAM
Well who is he?

( ... )

GRACE
(POINTING AT ADAM)
I thought he was my stud.

OSCAR
I never know with you! Anything in trousers it seems.

GRACE
How dare you!

ADAM
Yes, how dare you! Speaking of your wife like that.

OSCAR
(SQUARING UP)
I'll speak of my wife how I want! It's none of your business.

ADAM
(ALSO SQUARING UP)
It's my business if someone insults my leading lady!

OSCAR
Oh yes?

ADAM
(NOSE TO NOSE)
Yes.

OSCAR
Oh yes?

ADAM
Yes!

GRACE
Pathetic! Cut it out boys. Save it for the playground.

OSCAR
Grrrr!

ADAM
Grrrr!

THEY BREAK APART. HAILEY ENTERS

( ... )

GRACE
I took it out earlier because I was going to wear it. My necklace – given me by Prince Abdul. It's gone! It's... we've... someone's taken it!

SHE GLARES ROUND THE ROOM

GRACE
Who?

PAUSE. EVERYONE IS FROZEN

GRACE
It must be somebody here.

ADAM
It could have been the staff.

GRACE
Who, if he's up to murder, is probably up to theft as well....

OSCAR
Ludicrous!

GRACE
My leading man, who's earning almost as much as I am, but has big tax problems....

ADAM
Absurd!

GRACE
And who got here from his hotel remarkably quickly....

ADAM
Well of course I did!

( ... )

GRACE
No? Well then, so be it.
(PROCLAIMS)
'Once more unto the breach, and let loose the hounds of war!'

ADAM
Dogs.

GRACE
What?

ADAM
Dogs of war. That's what Shakespeare wrote.

( ... )

BONIFACE
So, I will leave the explication of all the identities for the moment - the first thing is to search everyone.

ALL
(PROTESTING)
Oh no.... that's not on.... you can't demand that.... (ETC)

( ... )

BONIFACE
Enough!
(PATS DOWN OSCAR)
Thank you, monsieur. Please stand aside. Now, the actor.
(INDICATES ADAM)
This one, yes?

GRACE
Yes.

BONIFACE
Please monsieur.

ADAM
(RELUCTANTLY)
I object to this.

EMPTIES HIS POCKETS

BONIFACE
Wallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....

OSCAR
Hah!

BONIFACE
....packet of unmentionables. Small size.

OSCAR
(TO GRACE)
Now who's the pot calling the kettle black?

GRACE
Nothing to do with me.

OSCAR
(THREATENING ADAM)
Well I can't think what else they're for.

ADAM
Emergencies – just like you.

( ... )

BONIFACE
Please, monsieur. I will decide who is likely.
(TO JIMMY)
Monsieur.

JIMMY EMPTIES HIS POCKETS

BONIFACE
Wallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....

ALL
Aha!

( ... )

BONIFACE
Perhaps. So now we try the actor's.
(PRESSES BUTTONS. GRACE'S PHONE ON THE DESK BUZZES)
Aha! Madame's phone, yes?

OSCAR
I knew it! He's her lover!

ADAM
Nonsense! I was....

OSCAR
What?

ADAM
Trying to call her back after she passed out.

( ... )

BONIFACE
Whose is this?
(LOOKS AT JIMMY)
Yours monsieur.

OSCAR
What?

ADAM
His?

( ... )

BONIFACE
So – your wife took a position with Monsieur Gervaise, so was able to inform you when Madame Gervaise was alone in the hotel, so you could invade her rooms and discover a celebrity story.

JIMMY
Er... something like that.

BONIFACE
And perhaps steal celebrity sparklers also?

JIMMY
No!

BONIFACE
(HOLDING UP THE BALACLAVA)
Is this balaclava hat yours?

JIMMY
No - never seen it before.

ADAM
Just a minute!

BONIFACE
What?

ADAM
(TO HAILEY)
What's your name?

HAILEY
Hailey.

ADAM
Aha! H! The message was from you.

BONIFACE
What message?

ADAM
On his phone. It came through just after I caught him. 'Don't do it. Leave now.'

( ... )

JIMMY
I, er... didn't want anyone to know I was a journalist.

OSCAR
Because....
(INDICATING ADAM)
I found him here, and he didn't know I was her husband, and I wanted to find out what he was doing here.

ADAM
Oh, really?

OSCAR
Yes, really.

ADAM
Grrrr!

( ... )

BONIFACE
(PROCLAIMING)
And finally - when everybody got here to the hotel, which one arrived wearing a balaclava hat, in time to put poison in Madame Gervaise's Caesar Salad??

GRACE
Yes. Who?

ALL
(EVERYONE LOOKS AT EVERYONE ELSE)

BONIFACE
Of course the answer is...

GRACE
What?

OSCAR
What?

ADAM
What?

( ... )

BONIFACE
Yes, that's everyone. And peanuts are easy to acquire.

GRACE
From your bar!

BONIFACE
From anyone's bar.
(TO ADAM)
Yours for instance.

ADAM
Ridiculous!

BONIFACE
Why?

ADAM
I'm her l... leading man. I'm completely innocent.

BONIFACE
Nobody is innocent, monsieur, until I have found them not guilty.

ADAM
You aren't the law here, Monsieur Boniface. We should have called the police – I said so in the first place.

BONIFACE
We do not need the police until I, Hercule Poirot of the Riviera, have discovered the culprits. Then we will decide how to handle the situation. Now – Madame Gervaise.

GRACE
Yes?

BONIFACE
What time did your husband leave this morning for his office?

GRACE
About nine oclock.

BONIFACE
Too early to put peanuts in your salad.

ADAM
Unless he nipped back later in his balaclava.

( ... )

BONIFACE
Monsieur actor.

ADAM
Yes?

BONIFACE
Where were you this morning before you got the call for help from Madame Gervaise?

ADAM
At my hotel – eating peanuts.

BONIFACE
Why aren't you staying at this hotel?

ADAM
Because that's a better hotel.

BONIFACE
(INDIGNANT)
There is no better hotel in Cannes than this hotel!

OSCAR
I'll tell you why. Because it would be too obvious he was having an affair with my wife if he stayed at the same hotel.

BONIFACE
Is this true?

ADAM
Certainly not!

BONIFACE
But you could have come to this hotel earlier, with your peanuts, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned Madame Gervaise's salad, and stolen her necklace at the same time.

ADAM
That's nonsense! If I'm having an affiar with her, why would I want to poison her?

( ... )

BONIFACE
Either one of these monsieurs, or madame bimbo, entered the apartment earlier by the balcony, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned madame's lunch when she was in the bedroom, stole her necklace, and left again.

ADAM
Left again?

BONIFACE
With the necklace, because it's not here. And then – this is the clever part - returned later to prove innocence. Voila the scenario!

OSCAR
Then why would they leave the balaclava?

BONIFACE
(DEFLATED)
Ah.
(BRIGHTENS)
They forgot to take it with them – proving they are an amateur. Which is all of you – amateurs!

ADAM
It doesn't make sense.

BONIFACE
Why not?

ADAM
Why would any one of us wish to poison a big film star like Grace, on the day of her premiere, and steal her jewellery at the same time, knowing that the whole world would then be on their tail?

> ACT 2 <

THE SAME, LATE THAT EVENING. THE ROOM IS IN DARKNESS, LIT ONLY BY MOONLIGHT FROM THE FRENCH WINDOWS. A DARK FIGURE APPEARS ON THE BALCONY. PEERS IN, RATTLES THE FRENCH WINDOWS AND ENTERS. IT IS JIMMY IN HIS DARK CLOTHES AND BALACLAVA.

JIMMY
(LOW VOICE)
Hello? Anyone here?

TAKES OFF THE BALACLAVA, GOES TO THE WASTE BIN AND PEERS IN. LIFTS IT UP AND SHAKES IT. IT IS EMPTY

JIMMY
Bugger!

LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM. AT THAT MOMENT THE SUITE DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND GRACE AND ADAM ENTER, SINGING AND DOING A TANGO TOGETHER. THEY ARE PRETTY SLOSHED. THEY TANGO AROUND THE SOFA AS JIMMY FLATTENS HIMSELF AGAINST THE WALL. AS HE SIDLES TOWARDS THE SUITE DOOR OSCAR AND HAILEY BURST IN, ALSO DOING A TANGO. JIMMY IS FORCED TO RETREAT. THE TWO COUPLES CIRCLE THE ROOM IN RIOTOUS FASHION, ONE OF THEM FLICKING ON THE LIGHTS AS THEY PASS. JIMMY COWERS BACK AGAINST THE WALL

GRACE
Tarararah!! What a night!

ADAM
What a wonderful night!

GRACE
The film is a sensation – Palme d'Or here we come! Helen Mirren eat your heart out!

ADAM
Meryl Streep – time to retire!

HAILEY
Wooooo!

SHE SUDDENLY NOTICES JIMMY HIDING BY THE WALL. FRANTICALLY WAVES HIM TOWARDS THE DOOR, AT THE SAME TIME TWISTING OSCAR'S BACK TO HIM. JIMMY CREEPS TOWARDS THE OPEN DOOR

GRACE
Adam, order champagne!

OSCAR
More champagne?

GRACE
The night is young! The moon is bright! The stars are shining!

ADAM
None brighter than yours! And mine of course.

GRACE
Next stop the Golden Globes!

OSCAR
Then the Oscars!

ADAM
(ON THE PHONE)
Champagne please – two bottles to Grace Gervaise's suite.

JUST AS JIMMY REACHES THE DOORWAY GRACE SEES HIM

GRACE
Oh look, it's our little paparazzi man! Following us around, are you, Jimmy boy?

JIMMY IS CAUGHT IN THE DOORWAY AS IF HE HAS JUST ARRIVED. SHE WAVES HIM IN

GRACE
Come in and join the party. We're celebrating!

JIMMY
Er....

OSCAR
The film is a success!

ADAM
The performance of Grace's life!

GRACE
Yes!

ADAM
And mine too of course.

JIMMY
(HESITATING IN THE DOORWAY)
Oh, good.

GRACE
There's your story, paparazzi man. Tell the world!

ADAM
Write the headlines!

GRACE
Come in, come in! Rescue your wife from my husband's lecherous clutches.

JIMMY
Well, er.....

HE HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND HIS BACK AND COMES BACK INTO THE ROOM

GRACE
(TO ADAM)
We're going to party all night, aren't we lover?

ADAM
Yes!

GRACE
Until the critics bring us back to earth of course.

OSCAR
As they always do.

ADAM
Stuff the critics!

OSCAR
Bugger the critics!

GRACE
To hell with the lot of them! What do they know?

HAILEY IS SIGNALLING QUESTIONS TO JIMMY. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND GESTURES HOPELESSLY. HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND A SOFA CUSHION. GRACE IS DANCING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO ADAM

GRACE
Mmmm! The audience loved me – that's what matters.

ADAM
(HIS HAND ON HER BOTTOM)
They adored you!

GRACE
Yes!

ADAM
And me of course.

GRACE
Mmmmm!

ADAM
Ahhhh!

OSCAR
Yes, well you can stop adoring each other. Take your hands off my wife's bottom, gigolo!

ADAM
Hey!

GRACE
You take your eyes off the bimbo's bust.

HAILEY
(ROLLING HER EYES)
Ohhhh!

GRACE
Tonight is my night! Nothing is going to spoil its glory.

ADAM
Nothing!

OSCAR
Aren't you forgetting something?

GRACE
What?

OSCAR
A certain missing necklace.

49
DEFLATING

GRACE
Oh yes.

ADAM
Oh yes, that.

GRACE
Why did you remind me? My beautiful necklace!

JIMMY
You, er... still haven't found it?

GRACE
Of course I haven't, silly boy. I'd be wearing it, wouldn't I?
(THEATRICAL)
The prince will never forgive me!
(WEEPS)
It's a tragedy!

ADAM
There now, Grace, it'll turn up.

GRACE
How? Where? It's gone for ever! The thing I loved most in the whole world!

OSCAR
Oh, thanks very much.

GRACE
It was worth ten of you, you bimbo bonker!

HAILEY
Ohhh!

OSCAR
That's rich coming from you – gigolo juggler!

ADAM
Hey!

GRACE
Hot totty tippler!

OSCAR
Smarmy stud smoocher!

GRACE
You're drunk!

OSCAR
So are you!

GRACE
I hate you!

OSCAR
I despise you!

HAILEY
Hey – stop it!

ADAM
Cut it out! We don't want more attempted murders – we've had one already.

( ... )

JIMMY
I didn't think you'd want it to, er....

GRACE
My husband certainly wouldn't. But never mind. My wonderful film is the real story! The coup de Grace!

GRABS ADAM AND TWIRLS

GRACE
Tara!!!

ADAM
Tara!!

HAILEY GOES TO JIMMY TO CONFER IN A CORNER, JUST AS MONSIEUR BONIFACE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY WITH TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE IN ICE BUCKETS

BONIFACE
Felicitations a tout le monde!

GRACE
Monsieur Boniface!

BONIFACE
I hear the premiere is a big success! I bring you champagne myself to celebrate. Courtesy of the Hotel Superb.

OSCAR
Well thank you!

ADAM
Wonderful!

BONIFACE BRINGS THE CHAMPAGNE TO THE SIDE TABLE

BONIFACE
All of Cannes is talking about it. Do we have glasses?
(POINTS TO THE SIDE)
Yes.

OSCAR FETCHES THE GLASSES. HAILEY ASSISTS

BONIFACE
I am told madame's performance is a wonder to behold!

GRACE
Well of course....

ADAM
And mine too.

( ... )

BONIFACE
(RAISES GLASS)
The Gervaises!

ALL
(RAISING GLASSES)
The Gervaises!

( ... )

GRACE
My God! Perhaps he was here when I was murdered!

OSCAR
Almost murdered.

ADAM
Perhaps he was the murderer.

( ... )

BONIFACE
Perhaps for distraction. Perhaps to make way for the theft. Who knows? They say these people are extremely ruthless.

OSCAR
My god!

ADAM
That's terrible.

BONIFACE
However – everyone here is still a suspect until the true suspects are proved guilty and the false suspects are proved innocent!

OSCAR
Fatuous!

ADAM
Preposterous!

( ... )

BONIFACE
Madame, monsieur! This is not the way for imminent show business people to behave. Especially in front of the press.

JIMMY
No, quite.

GRACE
Well it's time the press exposed my sham of a husband.

OSCAR
And my mockery of a wife.

BONIFACE
Please, please – these are not the kinds of stories we want in the papers.
(TO ADAM)
You agree, monsieur?

ADAM
Absolutely. A little discretion, please!

OSCAR
You keep out of this! It's none of your business, you ham actor!

ADAM
Ham actor! How dare you, you... you....

AT THAT MOMENT HE GRABS HIS THROAT AND EMITS A TERRIBLE CHOKING SOUND

BONIFACE
Monsieur? What is the matter?

ADAM
I... I'm....

COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AND CONVULSES.

( ... )

BONIFACE
Oh, this is a calamity! This is a cataclysm!
(ALMOST WEEPING)
My hotel will be ruined! Nobody will ever wish to stay here again!

GRACE
Nonsense, Monsieur Boniface - they'll all flock to see the scene of the crime. You'll be famous!

ADAM
(AT THAT MOMENT ADAM APPEARS SHAKILY IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY)
Hello everyone. What's going on?

BONIFACE
(STUNNED)
Monsieur!!

GRACE
Adam! My lover!

ADAM
I heard bangs.

GRACE
(RUSHING TO HIM)
You're alive!

ADAM
Of course I'm alive.

BONIFACE
But you were poisoned, monsieur!

ADAM
Rubbish. I just had an attack. I'm an epileptic. It happens sometimes when I'm stressed.

OSCAR
An eciplect... a plecipept... ?

ADAM
It knocks me out for a few moments, that's all. Nothing too serious.

GRACE
Oh, thank heavens! I thought I'd lost you.

ADAM
'Fraid not, old girl. Still here to do your next film.

BONIFACE
But this is insane! She has killed her husband!

ADAM
What?

BONIFACE
She thought he had poisoned you.

ADAM
(STARING AT OSCAR'S BODY)
You killed Oscar?

BONIFACE
She shot him. In front of me. In front of the paparazzi!

ADAM
Oh my God, Grace! You shot him? What have you done??

BONIFACE
It is the end of everything!

ADAM
You'll go to prison for life!

GRACE
(CALMLY)
Oh stop making such a drama of it. He's all right.

ADAM
What?

BONIFACE
What?

GRACE
(HOLDING UP THE GUN)
It's the prop gun from the film. It only fires blanks.
(TO OSCAR)
Get up, you pansy! There's nothing wrong with you!

OSCAR STIRS AND SITS UP. EVERYONE GASPS

OSCAR
Oh well, that was quite fun, wasn't it?

ADAM
What the...?

( ... )

EVERYONE TURNS TO LOOK. SHE PASSES OUT ON THE FLOOR. THEY RUSH TO HER

BONIFACE
No, no, no! Not another one!

GRACE
Oh, the poor bimbo! What's the matter with her?

OSCAR
She can't be epileptic too.

ADAM
She's been poisoned!

( ... )

JIMMY
Yes, but nobody's died. We're all here. Everything's all right.

HAILEY
You promise?

JIMMY
Yes, yes.

OSCAR
This is beyond a joke!

ADAM
Hear, hear.

( ... )

BONIFACE
So much so that he gives you priceless necklaces and holidays on his yacht. What else does he love about you, eh?

GRACE
My vital measurements too of course.

OSCAR
Hah!

ADAM
Oh for heaven's sake you two, cut it out!

( ... )

GRACE
I put it here I tell you! I was going to put it in its case, and then Adam distracted everyone.
(TO ADAM)
This is your fault!

ADAM
Oh please!

( ... )

BONIFACE
(RESIGNED)
Search the room everyone!

ALL
(THEY ALL SEARCH THE ROOM, JIMMY AND HAILEY PRETENDING TO JOIN IN)

GRACE
The doors are all closed. No-one has left. It has to be here!

OSCAR
It isn't.

ADAM
Nothing.

( ... )

BONIFACE
(COLLAPSING ONTO THE SOFA)
I think I am imagining this whole day. I think it is a reverie from which I will soon awake.
(DISCOVERS THE BALACLAVA)
Wait a minute. What is this? Another balaclava!
(HOLDS IT UP)

ADAM
It's the same one.

( ... )

OSCAR
There now, Grace, calm down. It's only jewellery.

GRACE
Only jewellery! It's the most beautiful thing I ever owned!

ADAM
It'll turn up. We all saw it and nobody's gone out. It can't have gone far, can it Monsieur Boniface?

BONIFACE
(SHRUGGING)
They are so clever these Riviera thieves. They have such tricks. Maybe this time they somehow.... What do you think, Mr Paparazzi man?

JIMMY
It's a mystery. What do you think, Hailey?

HAILEY
It's incredible. They've really got away with it!

BONIFACE
What can I say? Even I am bimboozled.

GRACE
(RECOVERING)
Oh well - easy come, easy go.

OSCAR
What?

ADAM
What are you saying?

GRACE
(OFFHAND)
It doesn't really matter. It wasn't worth anything anyway.

OSCAR
What do you mean?

GRACE
It wasn't the real necklace. It was a replica.

JIMMY
What?

HAILEY
What?

GRACE
I never wear the real thing – it's too valuable.

BONIFACE
It wasn't...! Where is the real one?

GRACE
In your hotel safe, Monsieur Boniface. Where I trust it's really safe. Unless your chef has access to it.

ALL
(GASPS OF INCREDULITY ALL ROUND. JIMMY AND HAILEY ROLL EYES AT EACH OTHER)

( ... )

GRACE
Don't be such a defeatist, Monsieur Poirot of the Riviera. This cannot be insoluble. Adam, I put you in charge of investigations. Retrace everyone's movements second by second from the time you collapsed.

ADAM
Why me?

GRACE
Because you're the only one who couldn't have taken it. You were unconscious.

OSCAR
No! He woke up before the theft was discovered.

GRACE
So what? He was half ga-ga.

OSCAR
A clever ploy.

GRACE
Don't be silly. Adam, carry on.

ADAM
(RESIGNED)
Very well, if you say so.

GRACE
Start with my husband.

OSCAR
Ludicrous! I steal my own wife's imitation jewels?

GRACE
You didn't know they were imitation. I never told you because I never trusted you.

OSCAR
Oh, thank you very much. That's....

GRACE
Silence! Adam.

ADAM
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY)
All right. Oscar, tell the company what you did when I collapsed?

( ... )

GRACE
I wasn't pissed.

OSCAR
You're still pissed now.

GRACE
Nonsense - I'm perfectly sober.

OSCAR
You're never sober. You don't know what sober means. You....

ADAM
Quiet!! Or I'll murder you both myself!
(THEY RETREAT)
Anyway, I don't see how he can have done it. He was on the floor half the time.

GRACE
All right, we'll come back to him. What about Monsieur Boniface?

BONIFACE
Me??

GRACE
When I went into the bedroom you were left alone in here with the necklace.

BONIFACE
(SIGHING)
Ah mon dieu! Now I am a jewel thief.

ADAM
Well we never actually searched you, did we Monsieur Boniface?

( ... )

GRACE
All right. Now the paparazzi man and his bimbo.

HAILEY
Ohh!

JIMMY
Please stop calling my wife a bimbo.

GRACE
Sorry. The paparazzi man and his totty.

HAILEY
Uh!

ADAM
(TO JIMMY)
Well? What were your movements?

JIMMY
(INDICATING OSCAR)
Well, the same as his. We helped carry you in there. We didn't come back until the shots.

GRACE
Ah, but then what?

JIMMY
Well, we.... we....

HAILEY
We watched him (ADAM) come back from the dead, and then we watched him (OSCAR) come back from the dead, and then we watched her and him (GRACE AND OSCAR) continue to try and kill each other, and then I fainted, and then we watched Monsieur Boniface quietly losing his mind.

BONIFACE
Yes, thank you. I haven't found it yet.

ADAM
(TO GRACE)
Well that hasn't proved anything. We're still no closer.

( ... )

GRACE
I think little Jimmy and his pretty partner can tell us.

EVERYONE STARES AT THE PAIR

BONIFACE
Eh?

OSCAR
What?

JIMMY
Us?

GRACE
Yes, you, you pseudo paparazzi man. You clever pair of innocents. You're no journalist. She's no secretary. You're the Riviera jewel thieves, aren't you?

HAILEY
Us?

GRACE
You think you can pull the wool over my eyes? Me, the expert on every convoluted film plot ever written? The star of half the crime melodramas ever made? I rumbled you two the moment you met here.

BONIFACE
Is this true? You are the Riviera jewel thieves?

JIMMY
(BASHFUL)
Well.... I suppose there's no point in denying it now.

OSCAR
Good God!

ADAM
Bloody hell!

( ... )

OSCAR
(POINTING AT ADAM)
Is he your lover, or isn't he your lover?

GRACE
Of course he's not my lover.

ADAM
Of course I'm not her lover.

OSCAR
How do I know that?

GRACE
He blows the other way, you fool!

OSCAR
What?

GRACE
He's gay. He's a poof. Aren't you, Adam?

ADAM
Yeh.

OSCAR
You're gay?

ADAM
Bent as a hairpin. But don't tell my fans.

( ... )

GRACE
We're not really such a bad team, are we?

OSCAR
No. Oh, I'm relieved! I didn't really want to lose you.

GRACE
Of course you didn't. Where else would you find a prima donna like me to brighten your life?

ADAM
Exactly.

GRACE
You'd be bored to death without me to dramatise our affairs.

OSCAR
And you'd be lost without me to manage your affairs.

GRACE
Of course I would.
(THEY CLASP EACH OTHER)

OSCAR
Ahhh!

GRACE
Ahh!

ADAM
(CLAPPING)
Hurrah! All friends again.
