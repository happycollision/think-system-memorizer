Title: Come From Away
Authors: David Hein & Irene Sankoff

.Scene 1

# Song 1: Welcome To The Rock

A bodhran beats a fast rhythm.

CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there's an airport—it used to be one of the biggest airports in the world. And next to it, is a town called Gander.

OZ
There's a two-person police department.

BEULAH
An elementary school.

BONNIE
An SPCA.

JANICE
A local TV station.

DOUG
And a hockey rink.

CLAUDE
It's a small place—on a giant rock in the ocean. Everybody knows everybody else. And everybody in this room has a story about how they started that day.

ALL
~Welcome to the rock! If you come from away
~You'll probably understand about a half of what we say
~They say no man's an island, but an island makes a man

CLAUDE, OZ, BEULAH, BONNIE
~'Specially when one comes from one like Newfoundland

ALL
~Welcome to the rock

BEULAH
That morning, I'm in the classroom. It's our first day back and the school busses are on strike, so I'm covering for Annette, who's running late!

ANNETTE
Sorry, Beulah! How's the kids?

BEULAH
Not exactly thrilled to be inside on such a gorgeous day, so I told them we'd only have a half-day this morning — and they were quite pleased — until I told them we'd have the other half in the afternoon.

SINGER 8
~Welcome to the wildest weather that you've ever heard of

SINGER 12
~Where everyone is nicer, but it's never nice above

SINGER 6
~Welcome to the farthest place you'll get from Disneyland

SINGER 11
~Fish and chips and shipwrecks

WOMEN & SINGER 11
~This is Newfoundland

MEN
~Welcome to the rock

WOMEN
~I'm an islander, I am an islander

ALL
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander

OZ
That morning I'm in my car. The kids cross Airport Boulevard to get to school —and that time a day people are in a little bit of a rush to get to work and stuff, so normally I sit there and run my radar.

OZ cues the cast to make a "WOOP-WOOP" noise together.

OZ (CONT'D)
And if they're speeding, I'll stop 'em and write out a warning ticket. I'll write "STFD" - Slow The Fuck Down.

ACTOR 2
~Welcome to the land where the winters tried to kill us
~And we said

ALL
~We will not be killed

ACTOR 9
~Welcome to the land where the waters tried to drown us
~And we said

ALL
~We will not be drowned

ACTOR 3
~Welcome to the land where we lost our loved ones
~And we said

ALL
~We will still go on

ACTOR 10
~Welcome to the land where the winds tried to blow

ALL
~And we said no

BONNIE
That morning, I drop my kids off at school and head to the SPCA, where I'm greeted by my other kids - all barking and meowing for breakfast and a belly rub. Not that I'm complaining. I loves 'em. But by the time feeding's done, I've got to get back to pick up my human kids. So, I take just one second for myself. And I'm sitting in my car.

BEULAH
I'm in the staffroom.

ANNETTE
I'm in the library.

BONNIE, BEULAH & ANNETTE
And I turn on the radio.

ALL
~You are here
~At the start of a moment
~On the edge of the world
~Where the river meets the sea
~Here—on the edge of the Atlantic
~On an island in between
~There and here

ALL
(repeated hushed underneath)
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander...

OZ
I'm running my radar when Bonnie comes by. She pulls up, and she's wavin' at me like mad, so I roll down my window and she says...

BONNIE
Oz, turn on the radio!

OZ
Slow it down, Bonnie.

BONNIE
Jesus H.! Oz! Turn on your radio!

COMPANY
~Where our stories start

JANICE
It's my first day at the station.

COMPANY
~Where we'll end the night

GARTH
I'm getting coffee for the picket line.

COMPANY
~Where we know by heart

CRYSTAL
Five minutes 'til my smoke break.

COMPANY
~Every single flight

DWIGHT
I'm off to work at the airport.

MEN
~Welcome to the fog
~Welcome to the trees,
~To the ocean — and the sky
~And whatever's in between
~To the ones who've left

MEN (CONT'D)
~You're never truly gone
~A candle's in the window
~And the kettle's always on

ALL
~When the sun is coming up
~And the world has come ashore
~If you're hoping for a harbour
~Then you'll find an open door
~In the winter from the water
~Through whatever's in the way
~To the ones who have come from away
~Welcome to the rock!

.Scene 2

CLAUDE
I starts my day at Tim 'Ortons. Don't drink coffee. Don't drink tea. An' I've no use for donuts. But I'll grab a Pepsi and get a lay o' the land. As the Mayor, it's 'ow I keep in touch with the people an' such. Everything starts and ends at Tim 'Ortons.

CLAUDE enters Tim Hortons.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
Morning, Garth.

GARTH (ACTOR 8)
Morning, Claude.

CLAUDE
Morning, Crystal.

CRYSTAL
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

CLAUDE
Dwight.

DWIGHT
Morning Claude. Garth. Crystal.

DOUG
Claude. Crystal. Dwight. Garth. Morning.

CRYSTAL
Morning, b'ys. Pepsi?

CLAUDE
That's right, Crystal. What's the news? School bus strike still on?

DWIGHT
Ahya. We're working it out.

GARTH
Well, we're coming to the table.

CLAUDE
Well, we're coming to the table too.

DWIGHT
Are they tearing down the airport?

CLAUDE
Not today.

DOUG
(changing the subject)
I heard Don Burton and his wife won the Super 7!

CLAUDE
You don't say.

DWIGHT
Lucky shit.

DOUG
4.6 million.

THEY all whistle. JANICE enters.

JANICE
Excuse me, I'm looking for the Mayor.

EVERYONE points at CLAUDE.

JANICE (CONT'D)
Mister Mayor —I'm Janice Mosher with Rogers TV. I'm new. To town—and new to reporting. It's my first day.

CLAUDE
Where you longs to, Janice?

JANICE
Port Aux Basque. So if you see me running red lights or anything, just forgive me because we don't have stop lights over there.

CLAUDE
Well welcome to Gander, Janice.

DWIGHT
Janice.

GARTH
Janice.

DOUG
Janice.

CRYSTAL
Janice.

CLAUDE
If you're looking for news, you should talk to that man running in here. That's our constable, Oz Fudge. He's full of stories.

OZ runs in.

OZ
Mister Mayor, I saw your car in the lot. Crystal, turn up the radio so's we all can hear. Doug, you probably want to get down to Air Traffic Control right away.

DOUG
There's only supposed to be two air traffic controllers on, but instead there's fourteen... Everyone's heard and they all shows up without even being asked. We're told there'll be over 200 planes getting diverted across the country.

.Scene 3

# Song 2: Diverted

Everyone becomes AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS as the bodhran starts beating slowly.

The flight attendant button goes "BOONG-BOONG."

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)
Ladies and Gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Looks like we'll be making an unexpected landing in Gander, Newfoundland.

The PASSENGERS start murmuring restlessly. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns to the audience, and the PASSENGERS freeze.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Anybody in the business knows when you set down in Gander, it's for an emergency. Now, we don't know what's going on, but the Captain tells us to keep everyone from panicking.

The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns back, as the PASSENGERS unfreeze.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Tray tables up, please. We will be dimming the lights in the cabin. Pushing the light-bulb button will turn your reading light on; however, pushing the flight-attendant button will not turn your flight attendant on.


.Scene 5

Everyone become PASSENGERS, facing sideways. One of the passengers, DIANE, turns out the window.

DIANE  
I look out the window to see if there’s something mechanical —like if we've lost an engine or if something’s on fire. But I don’t see anything.

Another passenger, NICK, turns out his window.

NICK  
I told head office I need to travel less —I told them it was doctor’s orders. But they say, “You're going to the conference,” so you go.

BOB turns out his window.

BOB  
My dad is always saying, Bob, you've got to calm down. But the flight attendant is shaking like a leaf, so I figure I’ve got permission.

HANNAH turns out her window.

HANNAH  
My son sends me on this vacation—he says, “Mom, you've never gone anywhere.” And when I get back, I'm telling him — this is exactly why.

KEVIN T turns out his window.

KEVIN T  
Suddenly, there's a drop.

The GROUP drops, with a gasp.

A sudden change in direction. And I fly a lot, so I know that's not normal. Outside the window, all I can see below are trees and rocks and... nothing.

.Scene 6

BEVERLEY  
On final approach, we're coming into runway two-two, and I think, "Where am I going to park this thing?" There are planes lined up like sardines. And as far as I can see there’s cars lined up too. It looks like everybody in Newfoundland is here.

The TOWNSPEOPLE stand looking upward.

JANICE  
Is this on? Sorry. I’m new. This is Rogers TV Channel 9. My name is Janice Mosher and I'm reporting live from Gander Airport where the 19th plane has just touched down. I'm here with...

BONNIE  
Bonnie Harris. On a normal day, we get a half dozen flights, and now we've already got three times that many landing in two hours. It’s a lot of noise. You can smell the fuel. You can smell the exhaust.

OZ  
Jaysus, that’s a jumbo! There’s gotta be two-fifty or three hundred on her. That's a fairly large one, there’s gotta be two hundred on her- now, I’m adding this up. We got 38 planes — we got two, three hundred people on the average...

ALL Unless Speaking  
~Thirty-eight, thirty-eight  
~Planes

OZ  
Holy shit!

.Scene 7

At the Town Hall, everyone becomes STAFF who shout for CLAUDE as he enters, trailed by JANICE.

STAFF STAFF STAFF STAFF STAFF  
Claude! Excuse me. Claude! The Claude? Mister Mayor? Phones are ringing off the hook!

STAFF  
Mister Mayor! Claude! I just need to talk to you. Heard from Ottawa.

CLAUDE whistles for attention and points to STAFF 10.

STAFF 10  
Air traffic control says five of the planes on the ground aren’t responding.

STAFF 9  
Reg says they're probably just on the wrong frequency.

CLAUDE  
Thank you, Dwight.

STAFF 12  
FAA won't give us a timeline for reopening the airspace.

STAFF 9  
And the airplane crews need to be rested or we'll never get them out of here.

STAFF 7 (OZ)  
American Transatlantic flight number 25 is requesting that when they deplane, they be a priority...

CLAUDE  
Why?

STAFF 7 (OZ)  
They were headed to Disneyworld with 90 Wish Kids.

CLAUDE  
Oh, Jaysus.

STAFF 6  
Even with all the hotels in town, we've got no room—we gotta start looking at other towns.

STAFF 5  
Appleton and Gambo have already offered—but we can’t get them there.

STAFF 1  
(pointing at Garth)  
Garth’s bus drivers are still on the picket line—and without them no one’s going anywhere.

CLAUDE  
Oh for Jaysus sake, I'll tell them where to go.  
(to JANICE)  
Don’t quote me on that.

STAFF 2  
(covering the phone)  
I've got the SPCA lady on the line again asking about animals —

CLAUDE  
Tell Bonnie we've got people to deal with.

STAFF 4  
Claude! Apparently those five planes that aren’t responding? They’re treating them as bomb threats!

EVERYONE begins to panic.

STAFF 8 ^  
Why are we getting the bomb threats?

STAFF 12 ^  
Oh no. Donny’s down there. He just headed down there!

STAFF 5 ^  
Bomb threats! What do they mean Bomb threats?

STAFF 9 ^  
My kids are watching those planes.

STAFF 7 ^  
Why were they even sent here? Why not Toronto?!

STAFF 1 ^  
How many are we getting?

STAFF 10 ^  
Half the town’s gone down to watch!

STAFF 2 ^  
What are we supposed to do?

STAFF 4 ^  
They don’t know what's on them!

STAFF 6 ^  
Do we evacuate the town? What do we do? Who’s on them?!

CLAUDE puts his fingers to his lips and whistles.

CLAUDE  
Alright! The RCMP is gonna handle it. But we’ve got almost seven thousand people who might be spending the night. Jaysus, that’s near as many as we got living here in town. We need to house them somewhere and we need to get them there —

GARTH  
Don't look at me!

CLAUDE  
Not to mention food and supplies and anything else that snarls up.

STAFF 12  
Well, why are they sending them here? Why not Toronto or Ottawa?

CLAUDE looks at them all.

CLAUDE  
Because if anything goes wrong, we have a lot less people to lose.

A slight pause as they all take that in.

Alright, Janice Mosher. Here’s your news. Gander Town Council declares a state of emergency.

# Song 4: Blankets and Bedding

JANICE

ALL

BEULAH  
~Crystal, I saw on the news  
~That they’re looking for  
~Blankets and bedding

CRYSTAL (ACTOR 1)  
~Do you know what they need  
~And how much

MARTHA (ACTOR 5)  
~I need something to do

MARTHA, CRYSTAL & BEULAH  
~'Cause I can’t watch the news anymore

ANNETTE (ACTOR 6)

~No, I can’t watch the news anymore

WOMEN — GROUP 2  
~In the winter, from the water, through the wind

ALL WOMEN  
~If a stranger ends up at your door

BEULAH  
You get on the horn  
(on the phone)  
Hello? This is Beulah Davis down at the Academy. I heard we might be getting some guests and I thought I'd see if I could help whosever in charge of getting the school organized. How many passengers can we take? Uh— well, we fit about 400 students — yes, we could probably do 600. Or sure, 700, if we really pack them in. When are they coming? Could be any time now? Well, I’m glad I phoned!

OZ  
I get a call from Beulah looking for “anything 700 people from around the world might need.” So, I go down to Shoppers and the manager says to just take what I want off the shelves — toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash, deodorant. And I'm back at the school, when Beulah says...

BEULAH  
You know, those planes probably got some babies on ‘em...

A slight pause.

OZ  
So, I'm back to Shoppers for diapers. And we're unpacking them, when Annette says...

ANNETTE  
You know, those babies are probably going to be hungry...

A slight pause.

OZ  
So, I’m back to Shoppers for formula and baby food. And when I get back, Beulah says...

BEULAH  
You know, those planes are probably filled with women of child bearing age...

Another pause.

OZ  
Sooo?

BEULAH  
So, I’m back to Shoppers to pick up as many pads and tampons as they have.

OZ exits, wincing.

JANICE  
The Baptist Church needs a hand moving their pews... Doctor O’Brien down at the pharmacy is ready to fill any prescriptions. Oh, and the Lion’s Club is looking for some toilet paper, if you have any extra.

The WOMEN begin packing and stacking boxes.

ANNETTE  
~Medicine

MARGIE  
~Toothpaste

MARTHA  
~Underwear

BEULAH  
~Aspirin

CRYSTAL & ANNETTE

~Holy Jesus, there’s more!

ANNETTE  
~It’s better than being at home alone  
~Wondering what's really happening

MARGIE  
~Everyone's phoning

ANNETTE & BEULAH  
~We’re setting up rooms in the schools

MARGIE  
~Been crying all afternoon wondering  
~What can be done

The MEN enter carrying boxes across the stage.

MEN  
~What do we need?

ANNETTE  
I made a tray of sandwiches

BEULAH  
We need 50 more.

ANNETTE  
Sandwiches?

BEULAH  
Trays!

MEN  
~What do we need?

DWIGHT  
200 gym mats! Is that enough?

BEULAH  
You tell me and we'll both know.

MEN  
~What do we need?

JANICE  
For the love of God, stop bringing toilet paper to the Lion’s Club!

BARITONE MEN  
~How do you know what you need  
~When you don’t know how many you're needing to feed

Well we have to be, don’t we?

# Song 5: 28 Hours/Wherever We Are

On the plane, the PASSENGERS look out the window.

PASSENGER 1  
When you include the original flight, we were on the plane probably 12, 13 hours.

PASSENGER 8 (KEVIN T)  
We were on there 15 hours.

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
(correcting him)  
20 hours.

PASSENGER 10  
28 hours. We were on the plane for over an entire day.

ALL  
~28 hours  
~Over an entire day  
~There was one aisle in the middle  
~Everyone knew every inch of that plane

PASSENGER 11  
We were allowed out of our seats, but not off the plane.

ALL  
~28 hours

PASSENGER 8 (KEVIN T)  
You never think about it, but airplane doors are twenty feet in the air.

ALL  
~Over an entire day

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
And even if you survived the jump, they probably would’ve shot you.

ALL  
~There was one aisle in the middle

PASSENGER 10  
Everyone knew every inch of that plane.

PASSENGER 3  
~That plane  
~Everyone knew every inch of

You could go up to first class. You could stretch in the aisles.

ALL  
~28 hours

PASSENGER 4  
Our flight was full—there were children sleeping on the floor.

ALL  
~Over an entire day

PASSENGER 7  
It had three seats on each side. There was only one aisle in the middle.

ALL  
~There was one aisle in the middle

PASSENGER 2  
We had no way to get information.

PASSENGER 12  
~That plane  
~Everyone knew every inch of

This was before most people had mobile phones —and only a couple people got through.

PASSENGER 8  
Hello?

PASSENGER 7  
Mom?

PASSENGER 5  
Bonjour.

PASSENGER 2  
Operator?

BEVERLEY is alone in the cockpit. She holds a phone to her ear.

BEVERLEY  
~Tom? Oh, thank God.  
~I finally got through.  
~I borrowed a passenger’s phone.  
~How are you? Are the kids okay?  
~No I’m fine, Tom. I'm fine.  
~Safe and sound on the ground here in Newfoundland.  
~We don’t know much—except for the BBC  
~Listen, I can’t talk long  
~Can you do something for me?

PASSENGER 8  
I'm okay.

PASSENGER 7  
I’m fine.

PASSENGER 5  
Oui. Bien.

PASSENGER 2  
Pick up.

BEVERLEY  
~Tell the kids I'm alright  
~Take them into the kitchen  
~And show them the map  
~That we used to put pins in  
~For each destination  
~That we flew together  
~Tell them I’m fine  
~Put a pin here in Gander

PASSENGER 12  
On our plane, someone has a cell phone.

PASSENGER 10  
But then the battery dies. There are phones in the backs of the seats.

PASSENGER 9  
But they don’t work.

PASSENGER 4  
Half the passengers on our plane don’t speak English.

PASSENGER 11  
Even if we knew what was happening, we don’t speak their language.

PASSENGER 10  
On our plane, we ask the flight attendants.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)  
But the captain says not to say too much. And that’s when rumors start flying.

PASSENGERS start sharing what they've heard. Some lines repeat through the planes, building to everyone speaking at the end.

FRONT PLANE  
PASSENGER 5  
There was an accident

MID PLANE  
PASSENGER 12  
An accident?

BACK PLANE  
PASSENGER 9  
The US airspace is closed

PASSENGER 8  
For the first time in history.

PASSENGER 9  
A helicopter crashed in Pennsylvania

PASSENGER 11  
Why won’t she tell us what's happening?

PASSENGER 5  
A helicopter crashed into a building.

PASSENGER 10  
A building?

PASSENGER 8  
The White House!

PASSENGER 7  
The White House was bombed.

PASSENGER 3  
I need you to calm down, ma’am!

PASSENGER 9  
We need to do something. Everyone calm down!

PASSENGER 10  
It's World War 3! Ohmygod, it’s World War 3!

PASSENGER 4  
Tell us what is going on!

In another area, JOEY jumps onto his chair unsteadily, holding up a mini-bottle of liquor. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT tries to get him down.

JOEY  
~Woooooo!  
~Meanwhile on our plane  
~We didn't have a clue  
~We were all going insane because

ALL  
~There wasn't squat to do

JOEY  
~Then the captain starts apologizing  
~Says on behalf of the airline, I'm giving each and everyone some

ALL  
~Complimentary booze!  
~Open the airplane doors  
~Wave at all the cars  
~Hello to whoever you are—  
~Wherever we are

PASSENGER 1  
The ground crews supplied whatever we needed.

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
Nicotine patches.

Medication.

PASSENGER 5  
Pampers.

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, BOB & PARTY GIRLS  
Something to drink!

JOEY  
~So the flight attendants brought out all the mini bottles of liquor  
~And delivered them to everyone

ALL  
~Soon everyone got friendlier!

JOEY  
~I took a couple of pictures of the view there with my camera  
~We didn’t know where we were

ALL  
~But we knew that we were hammered!  
~Open the airplane doors! Wave at all the locals  
~Surely there's something better to do than park  
~Wherever we are

KEVIN T  
We'd been sitting there for 14 hours when we pull out the Grey Goose.

KEVIN J  
Kevin and I were kind of hiding it because, well...

KEVIN T  
Because we  
(indicating KEVIN J)  
didn’t want to share it. Anyway, this woman—this hot mess behind us kept completely freaking out.

DELORES is sitting behind them, completely freaking out.

DELORES  
I don’t understand why they can’t let us off. I mean, just to stretch our legs, I mean really? I need to get some air! Oh my god! I need to get off this plane!

KEVIN T  
And my boyfriend, Kevin— we're both named Kevin. It was cute for a while. Anyway, Kevin was not dealing with it well.

KEVIN J  
I'm going to kill her.

DELORES pushes the call button above her over and over.

DELORES  
Excuse me?! I would like to get off the plane. I am claustrophobic!

KEVIN J  
Excuse me! Would you like some Xanax? Because you are freaking out and it is freaking me out and we are all FREAKING THE FUCK OUT!!!

ALL  
~Open the airplane doors!  
~Let a little air in here  
~'Cause I could use a shower — or a bar (or a bar!)  
~Open the airplane doors!  
~Look at all the planes out there  
~There must be a convention, it’s bizarre  
~Wherever we are

GROUP 1 ^  
~28 hours  
~Out of the windows

GROUP 2 ^  
~28 hours  
~Nothing but darkness

GROUP 3 ^  
~28 hours  
~Darkness and headlights  
~28 hours  
~Nothing to see

BONNIE picks up her phone.

BONNIE  
Hello? It’s Bonnie Harris down at the Gander SPCA. I went down with the rest of the town to look at all those planes. Well, I got to wondering if there weren't any animals on them... No? There’s no animals on those planes? Not a one?! Okay, then. Thank you for your time.

She hangs up and dials another number.

Bonnie, are there animals on those planes?

DOUG  
Uh... Probably?

BONNIE  
“Probably.” Are they “probably” feeding them then? I’m heading over.

DOUG  
Bonnie, there’s armed guards, the army, police everywhere —

BONNIE  
Well, then they'll have to shoot me.

DOUG  
...Bonnie? Bonnie? Bonnie!

CLAUDE  
Look at it from my perspective. We've been coming to the table.

GARTH  
Will you look at it from MY perspective? We've been coming to the table too!

CLAUDE  
We've got the College, the churches and we've got the hotels for the crews. But we need your school busses. We've got no effing way to get them there...

GARTH  
Well, why don't you take them in your car?

CLAUDE  
Yeah, I can fit four in my Corolla, that's a great start.

UNION SUPPORTERS & TOWN STAFF  
Yeah, why don't you take them? Yeah, that's a great start.

GARTH  
That's a great start. Great.

CLAUDE  
Great. You think about it.

GARTH  
YOU think about it.

CLAUDE  
YOU think about it.

CLAUDE & GARTH  
Jaysus!

JANICE  
2:10pm. School bus drivers “thinking about” leaving the picket lines.

CLAUDE  
What's the point of an emergency if no one treats it like an effing emergency?... And you can quote me on that.

HANNAH  
The flight attendants keep telling us nothing’s wrong - but I’ve got kids and I’ve got grandkids —I know when someone's hiding something. And when parents need their kids to stop asking questions... They start playing movies.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
We ran through every movie we had: Legally Blonde, Doctor Dolittle 2, and... Titanic.

DELORES  
(totally drunk)  
~Near... far... wherever you —

ALL  
~Nothing to do, nothing to see  
~Thank God we stopped at the duty free  
~Wherever we are

NICK  
Do you mind if I sit here? I need to get some work done and there’s some drunk people at the back of the plane singing at the top of their lungs.

DIANE  
No... Of course. I’m Diane.

NICK  
Nick. How are you doing?

DIANE  
I’m worried about someone. He was flying today. I just wish there was some way to tell him where I am.

NICK  
Newfoundland —no, you know that— you just can’t tell him. Right. I’m hoping you're one of those people who laughs when English people say awkward things.

DIANE  
I just wish we knew what was happening.

ACTOR 2 (sotto)  
What's happening?

ACTOR 5 (sotto)  
What's happening?

SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN  
DIANE & NICK

DIANE  
~Your life

NICK  
~And your work

ALL  
~When the world may be falling apart

NICK & DIANE  
~And you think

DIANE  
~I’m alone

NICK  
~I'm alone

NICK & DIANE  
~And I'm so damn helpless

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY and the other DRUNK PASSENGERS stand together on their plane.

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, DRUNK PASSENGERS  
~There's nothing left to do but drink

Several PARTY GIRLS stand.

PARTY GIRLS (ACTORS 3 & 2)  
~We open the airplane doors  
~Flash all the cars  
~Wooo! I've never done that before

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, DRUNK PASSENGERS  
~28 hours gone over an entire day  
~Running out of things to say  
~And wondering if there’s someone

ALL  
~Going to clue us in  
~Tell us all what’s happening  
~Because the sun is setting  
~And we're sitting in the dark  
~Wherever we are

BOB  
Later that night, I’m up in the cockpit with some of the other passengers when the pilot puts the radio on over the intercom—and the whole plane goes silent when the President gives his speech.

PRESIDENT BUSH (ACTOR 8)  
ask the American people to join me in saying a thanks for all the folks who have been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens and to join me in saying a prayer for the victims and their families. The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake: we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless.

BEVERLEY  
~You got through to the airline  
~Tom, I'm okay — tell me what's happening out there  
~How bad is it — tell me everything  
~Tom. Who was in the air?  
~No-no, I wouldn't have known them  
~No-no one on that airline  
Charles...  
Are you sure?

The music fades away.

BEVERLEY (acapella)  
~No,  
~I’m fine, Tom.  
~I'm fine.

.Scene 10

# Song 6: Darkness and Trees

BOB  
We can see them from the plane —this long line of headlights coming through the darkness.

GARTH  
Claude, can I have a word with you?

CLAUDE  
Garth, I don’t have time to go in circles with you anymore. I’ve got the army delivering a thousand less cots than we were —

GARTH  
Look. The union just voted. You’ve got your busses. Our complaint’s with our employer, not with the people on those planes.

CLAUDE  
Thank you.

GARTH  
But we’re back on the line the minute this is over.

CLAUDE  
Right.

THEY shake hands.

ALL  
~Off of the airplane

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
Ladies and gentlemen, you can take only your carry-on items. Checked luggage will remain in the hold.

ALL  
~Into the airport

PASSENGER 1 (DIANE)  
The captain and flight attendants tell everyone to take their blankets and pillows off the plane.

ALL  
~Out of the windows

KEVIN T  
We grab bottles of water too —

KEVIN J  
No one has any idea where they’re taking us.

ALL  
~Darkness and trees

BOB  
As we enter the airport, all those car lights are still aimed at us.

HANNAH  
We're scared. They’re probably scared too.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
The people here don’t know what to expect off of these planes.

KEVIN T  
The airport looks like something left over from the Cold War. Kevin is like...

KEVIN J  
Oh my god. We've gone back in time.

BOB  
The whole procedure — the soldiers and all the formality — it just makes me really nervous.

Inside the airport, two CUSTOMS OFFICERS process PASSENGERS.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS (ACTORS 4 & 7)  
Citizenship?

DIANE  
American.

NICK  
British.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Purpose of your trip?

DIANE  
Vacation.

NICK  
Conference.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Destination?

DIANE  
Houston.  
Texas.

NICK  
Thank you.

PASSENGERS 1 and 12 are waved on, replaced by PASSENGERS 3 and 9.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Citizenship?

PASSENGER 3  
American.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Egyptian.

The CUSTOMS OFFICER and a few OTHERS stop to look at ALI.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Purpose of your trip?

PASSENGER 3  
Family.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Business... just business.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Destination?

PASSENGER 3  
LA.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Dallas — then Washington, D.C.

CUSTOMS OFFICER 4  
(to passenger 3)  
Thank you.

CUSTOMS OFFICER 7  
(to ALI)  
Could you come with me, sir?

BEVERLEY  
There’s a giant map on the wall of the airport and someone has written in red marker, “You are here.”

DIANE  
Excuse me. I need to find a phone.

HANNAH  
I need to call my son.

CUSTOMS OFFICER  
Phones are over there. But it's gonna be a while.

OZ  
They’re all lined up at the airport payphones —so eventually we put an “Out of Order” sign on them just so we can get people on the busses.

CLAUDE  
11:48 pm. Busses and drivers are now taking passengers to shelters, not just in Gander, but also to Gambo, Appleton, and farther communities of Lewisporte, Norris Arm, and Glenwood.

PASSENGER 12  
Our bus sits there forever.

PASSENGER 5  
While all the others leave. Finally, this other passenger gets on.

PASSENGER 4  
This guy from the Middle East.

PASSENGER 11  
Someone says he got questioned.

PASSENGER 2  
Someone says he got searched.

PASSENGER 1  
And now... he’s on our bus.

ALI slowly walks to the back of the bus as all the other passengers watch.

JANICE  
I try to interview the Red Cross, the Salvation Army ~ but they’ve got more important things to do than talk to me. That’s when I see them—the Plane People — through the bus windows. The terror on their faces. They have no idea where they’re going.

BEVERLEY  
They take me and my crew in a separate van and I'm looking out the window, trying to see where we are, but it is pitch dark. Now, I have flown over this area hundreds and hundreds of times. And it is just darkness — hardly any lights anywhere. And now here I am. Oh my god, this is just so remote.

.Scene 11

MEN  
~Into the darkness

WOMEN  
~Stars and the moonlight

MEN  
~But all around us  
~Nothing but darkness

WOMEN  
~Out of the windows

MEN  
~Into the darkness

ALL  
~Darkness and trees

GARTH enters and sits in front of a bus of passengers.

GARTH  
Every school bus we got is goin’ back and forth all night. Out at the Salvation Army Camp, we've delivered passengers from Germany, England, and France. And around three in the morning, my bus is designated to take all these African people out there.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Into the darkness

MUHUMUZA (ACTOR 10)  
My family and I try to see out the bus windows. No one tells us where we are going.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Onto a gravel road

GARTH  
Silence comes on the bus. We get outside of Gander and you could hear a pin drop.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~And all around us

MUHUMUZA  
My wife and daughter are scared. They ask me what is happening and I do not know.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Darkness and trees

GARTH  
Behind me, this big man comes up to me and he says in this low voice...

MUHUMUZA  
Wewe watuchukuwa wapi?

GARTH  
What?

At the Academy, BEULAH and ANNETTE address everyone.

BEULAH  
Ladies and gentlemen, we need some help translating. If anyone speaks Mandarin, can you come to the library? And if anyone speaks Hindi, could you please come to the cafeteria? And if anyone speaks Newfoundlander, well lard tunder’n jaysus god bless ya, b’y.

ANNETTE  
We've got passengers from all over the world coming off these busses, all speaking different languages. We can’t even say “hello.”

BEULAH  
And if anyone knows — we think it’s...

ANNETTE  
Moldovan.

BEULAH  
Moldovan — that would also be helpful.

ANNETTE  
Other passengers help us translate. Mrs. Noonan, our French teacher, turns out to know a little Russian. And Mr. Michaels, our gym teacher, apparently he speaks Spanish.

# Song 6a: Mr. Michaels

MR. MICHAELS stands, holding a shaker and dressed as a fantasy Latin lover. He moves to Annette.

MR. MICHAELS (ACTOR 7)  
~Si, hablo. Español es la lengua del amor. No sólo soy un profesor de gimnasia, soy un profesor de pasión.

He exits with a flourish.

ANNETTE  
I'm sorry, what was I saying?


.Scene 12

Meanwhile, in an airplane hold, BONNIE is searching with DOUG.

DOUG  
I said, you've got five minutes, Bonnie!

In the background, a dog barks quietly.

BONNIE  
There's hundreds of suitcases — I can hear barking — but I can't find them! They fast them before flying, so they're starving and they need water.

OFFICER STEPHENSON enters.

DWIGHT  
Sir? Sir! Oh, Doug. You got to get out of there. We're keeping all personnel out of the holds until —

DOUG  
Sorry, Dwight. It’s the wife you know, Bonnie — from the SPCA — she’s feeding some animals inside. Nothing’s coming off.

A cat meows.

BONNIE  
I found a cat! His name is Lyle! There’s a pill taped to his carrier. Well I’m glad I got in here to give it to him! It’s okay, Lyle.

DWIGHT  
Bonnie — I need you to get out of —

DOUG  
Bonnie, you got to move your arse!

BONNIE  
Doug, I have found one cat! Do you think it's Lyle who's barking?!  
(to Lyle)  
Here's some crunchy, Lyle. I'll be back to give you your pill.

DOUG  
(meekly underneath)  
No...

DWIGHT  
Listen to me — FAA sent over new orders — we're treating all U.S. planes as bomb threats.

DOUG  
Oh, god. Bonnie!

BONNIE  
Doug... Doug!

DOUG  
What? Bonnie? Bonnie, talk to me!

BONNIE  
Doug! There are monkeys on this plane.

.Scene 13

# Song 6b: Wheels on the Bus

Two bus drivers, MICKY and TERRY take a seat. They speak over their shoulders to their passengers, as they shift into gear and drive.

TERRY (ACTOR 7)  
Climb aboard.

MICKY (ACTOR 2)  
Hop right in! You look some tired.

TERRY  
Nothing to worry about now.

MICKY  
We'll get you where you're going.

TERRY  
I’m guessing you've never heard of Gander before. Well, that’s it in the rearview mirror.

MICKY  
You'll need to re-set your watches — we've got our own time zone here. Everything happens half an hour later in Newfoundland.

TERRY  
You've all seen the airport — used to be the biggest airport in North America. Planes used to stop here to gas up from everywhere.

MICKY  
Frank Sinatra. Albert Einstein.

TERRY  
Muhammad Ali.

BOTH  
The Queen.

TERRY  
This is where the Beatles first set foot in North America!

MICKY  
And my father once went sledding with Fidel Castro!

TERRY  
Then they invented jet planes that can get across the ocean on one tank...

MICKY  
So there's no need to refuel anymore...

TERRY  
Leaving us with this giant airport.  
There’s talk lately about tearing it down.

MICKY  
Lucky for you, we haven’t got around to it yet.

THEY brake suddenly, screeching.

MICKY  
Now there’s the reason I drives slow.

TERRY  
That there in the middle of the road.

MICKY & TERRY  
Yeah. That's a moose.

EVERYONE faces forward, motionless.

An incredibly long pause.

Even longer than that.

MICKY  
She’ll move when she’s good and ready.

.Scene 14

# Song 6c: Nick and Diane

On one of the busses, NICK approaches DIANE.

NICK  
Mind if I sit here? The drunk people from our plane are snoring back there...

DIANE  
Oh hello, Nick! Please do... I thought we'd lost you.

NICK  
No — I just needed to get an emergency prescription filled — my medication is in my suitcase. Nothing serious. Not like, “Ohmygod, he’s off his medication.” I'll stop talking now.

DIANE  
It’s fine.

NICK  
It's heart medication. I've got a slight arrhythmia — nothing serious. There you go — everything you need to know about me.

DIANE  
Okay. I’m allergic to bananas and I have never had the chicken pox.

THEY both smile.

NICK  
Any news yet about your husband who was flying today?

DIANE  
My —? No — do you mind if we just don't talk about that. I haven't been able to get to a phone.

NICK  
I'm sorry. I’ll help you find a phone as soon as we get... wherever we're going.

.Scene 15

# Song 6d: Darkness and Trees Reprise

GARTH  
Finally, out of the darkness, my bus arrives at the Salvation Army camp.

ALL (Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA)  
~Kati ya giza

MUHUMUZA  
We pass through a large gate and the bus pulls to a stop. And through the windows — out there in the darkness — we see all these people coming out of the buildings.

ALL (Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA)  
~Ghafa mwangaza

GARTH  
Now we rarely use them, but everyone’s dusted off their Salvation Army uniforms to welcome these people.

MUHUMUZA  
There are soldiers everywhere.

ALL (Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA)  
~Pande zote sisi

MUHUMUZA  
The man at the front opens the door.

GARTH  
I say, “Here you are. Out you go.” But he’s not moving. None of them are.

ALL (Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA)  
~Giza na miti

GARTH  
But then I notice his wife. Well, she’s clutching a bible. Now obviously I can’t read it, but it'll have the same number system ours does — so I ask to see it and I'm searching for something — and then in Philippians 4:6 — I give them their bible and I'm pointing and saying, look! Philippians 4:6 - Be anxious for nothing. Be anxious for nothing.

GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
And that’s how we started speaking the same language.

ALL  
~Kati ya giza (out of the darkness)  
~Ghafla mwangaza (suddenly brightness)  
~Ma-badiliko (everything changes)  
~Giza na miti (darkness and trees)  
~Kati ya giza (out of the darkness)  
~Ma-badiliko (suddenly light)

.Scene 16

BEULAH  
Welcome to Gander Academy — nicest hotel on the east coast, except for those with actual beds. My name’s Beulah. Washrooms are just down the hall. There’s food over there if you're hungry — and clothes, if you'd like to change. I’ll show you now where you’re going to sleep. Let us know if there’s anything else you need.

EVERYONE surrounds BEULAH.

KEVIN J  
So what really happened?

BEULAH  
Well... what's the last thing you heard?

KEVIN J  
There was an accident in New York.

BEULAH  
Okay... I'm going to show you now to your rooms, and then if you want to come back, we've got two TV's set up in the cafeteria with the news on — so you can see what's actually happened for yourselves...

# Song 6e: Lead Us Out Of The Darkness

JANICE  
I didn’t even think — they haven’t seen any of it yet.

ALL  
~Lead us out of the darkness

HANNAH  
We're all staring at those images.

BEULAH  
And we just stand helpless watching them.  
~Lead us somewhere to safety

BOB  
We barely know where we are, but we know it's not there.

ALL  
~Lead us far from disaster

BEVERLEY  
Charles Burlingame was the captain of Flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon. I just saw him at a Pub in London. You can’t imagine. A pilot will fight to the ends of the earth to save his airplane. He just will.

ALL  
~Lead us out of the night

KEVIN T  
We watch those images for hours.

THEY all stand and watch, unmoving. Suddenly THEY all react in shock.  
Until someone finally turns it off.

CLAUDE holds up a remote control and turns off the TV.

.Scene 17

CLAUDE  
1:15am.

ALL  
~Wednesday.

CLAUDE  
September 12th.

# Song 6f: Phoning Home

Crisis counselors are called to Gander Academy.

BEULAH  
The plane people — they're exhausted — but they don't want to sleep. And we’re standing there, ready with all that food. But that’s not what they wanted. They wanted phones.

JANICE  
1:45 am — Six phones are put on tables for the Plane People to use free of charge — lined up alongside the road by the NEW-tel building.

BEULAH  
An hour later, they setup 20 more phones.

CLAUDE  
An hour after that, there's 75 phones and computers with internet — all being used round the clock.

A number of PASSENGERS appear on telephones.

PASSENGER 5  
~Hello? Yes — it's me.

BOB  
~Dad, I’m okay. It’s okay.

PASSENGER 2  
~I’m calling from Canada.

KEVIN J  
~Safe and sound on the ground here in Iceland

KEVIN T  
~No, Newfoundland

BOB  
~Yeah.

ALL ON PHONES  
~We just saw the news

HANNAH  
~Have you heard yet from Kev?

KEVIN J  
~Or Celena

PASSENGER 5  
~Call Micah

PASSENGER 7  
~And Lauren

KEVIN T  
~My parents

PASSENGER 6  
~My aunt

DIANE  
~It’s Diane. No, I’m fine.  
Where’s David?

She covers her mouth and starts crying.  
Oh, thank God.

NICK  
Hello. It's Nick Marson — My plane's been diverted. Can you pass on to someone at head office that I'm fine? ...No, no — I just thought someone should know.

.Scene 18

# Song 7: Costume Party

JANICE  
3:45 am. Overnight, the community's population has gone from approximately 9,000 to 16,000. I’m sure barely any of us have slept tonight. We’re hopeful that our visitors will be back in the air come morning.

KEVIN T  
I woke up from a dream which I can’t quite remember, but there was this music in it that I’d heard somewhere before.

KEVIN J  
I woke up from a dream that we were stuck in some backwater Canadian town and that my air mattress deflated.

BOB  
I woke up to the smell of... freshly baked bread.

ANNETTE  
4am in Newfoundland is breakfast time in Germany. And we’ve got a lot of passengers here from Frankfurt, so breakfast starts at 4am and we start scrambling eggs.  
Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelettes.

BOB  
Fried Bologna.

DIANE  
Something called “toutans.”

NICK  
I saw a casserole dish I don’t think I could lift.

KEVIN T  
They made enough food to feed 7,000 people. It’s like they never slept.

BEULAH  
There’s this one man — from the Middle East — well, we don’t really know. Hasn’t said a word to a soul — and some of the other passengers seem a bit wary of him. So, it’s a little odd to find him poking around the kitchen.

ALI  
(surprised)  
Hello.

BEULAH  
Hello. Can I help you with something?

ALI  
I would like to be of assistance with the food.

BEULAH  
No. That’s not necessary.

ALI  
But I am —

BEULAH  
Really. You go out there and sit down.

CLAUDE  
We've been going all night, but we can’t stop. I splash some cold water on my face and just keep going. We’ve got 7,000 scared and angry people who don’t want to be here. And they’re about to wake up.

DIANE  
~In a crowded room filled with strangers sleeping

KEVIN T  
~An airplane blanket and pillow on the floor

DIANE  
~The sun comes streaming through the window

KEVIN T & DIANE  
~And I can’t sleep any more

KEVIN J  
~Staring at these strangers — waking up around me

HANNAH  
~Sitting in a crowd of people waiting for the phone

KEVIN J  
~And in a town that’s suddenly doubled population

KEVIN T, HANNAH, DIANE, & KEVIN J  
~I feel so alone

KEVIN J  
~It’s like any of us could have died on Tuesday

KEVIN T  
~And like we’re dared to see things differently today

DIANE  
~I'm feeling different

HANNAH  
~Distant

KEVIN J  
~Strange

KEVIN T  
~Who are these people here?

HANNAH  
~Where am I?

DIANE  
KEVIN T, HANNAH, DIANE & KEVIN J  
~Who am I if I don’t feel like the me from yesterday?

NICK  
I wake up in a crowded room full of people sleeping on the floor and I see Diane — and ask, “Are we leaving?”

DIANE  
Any time now.

NICK  
Is your hair different? I mean... you look good. I like it.

DIANE  
Oh! Thank you. No shampoo for three days.

KEVIN T  
They start handing out clothes to anyone who needs them.

KEVIN J  
I haven't changed my clothes in 39 hours.

BOB  
I wanted to burn my socks.

KEVIN J  
Kevin puts on this plaid thing. He says he’s “incognito” and that he’s going to “blend in with the natives,” but he just looks like a gay lumberjack.

DIANE  
~Changing into another woman's donated set of clothes

KEVIN T  
~Looking different — feeling kind of different too

DIANE  
~I can’t quite explain

KEVIN T  
~But when I woke

DIANE  
~When David wasn’t on that plane

KEVIN T & DIANE  
~It’s like I changed into somebody else — but who?  
~And it’s somehow like we’re at a costume party

KEVIN T  
~And for a second you are not yourself

DIANE  
~You are not yourself

KEVIN T  
~And you look around and blink your eyes

DIANE  
~And barely even recognize

KEVIN T & DIANE  
~The person in the mirror who’s turned into someone else

KEVIN J  
(On the phone)  
Hey Little Sister — Yeah, still here where they eat rainbows for breakfast. Are you taking care of mom? No. I’m just freaking out. I wish I was home. No, not LA. Brooklyn. Shut up. You're such a brat. No. I just needed to hear your voice.

BEULAH approaches HANNAH.

BEULAH  
Excuse me? Are you Hannah?

HANNAH  
(expectant)  
Yes — that’s me.

BEULAH  
My name’s Beulah. Someone told me your son’s a firefighter... Mine is too. Here in town. And I know Gander’s not New York, but... Is there anything I can do?

HANNAH  
No. I just need to hear from my son.

BEULAH  
I understand.

BEULAH leaves.

HANNAH  
~Praying for a phone call

KEVIN J  
~Praying for a way home

HANNAH & KEVIN J  
~Asking questions

KEVIN J  
~Asking can I get back on that godforsaken plane?

HANNAH  
~And all around me, people chat

KEVIN J  
~And people act like nothing’s happened

HANNAH & KEVIN J  
~And I need to hear we’re going back before I go insane

BEVERLEY  
Good morning. I’m Captain Beverly Bass. Now I know this is going to be hard to hear, but the American airspace remains closed. I can’t tell y’all how long we'll be on the ground. We are going to be here for some time.

PASSENGERS react in shock.

DIANE  
~Here for some time

KEVIN J  
~Here for some time

HANNAH  
~Here for too long

KEVIN T  
~Here for how long

KEVIN J, ACTORS 10, 12  
~When will we know

ACTORS 4, 5, 6 & 7, 11  
~When will we know

ALL  
~How much longer?

HANNAH  
Beulah, wait. Can you help me find a Catholic Church?

DIANE  
I can’t sit here. I need to get some air.

KEVIN T  
Let’s go see where we are. It'll do you good.

KEVIN J  
What'll do me good is to lie down and pretend this isn’t happening.

KEVIN T  
Suit yourself.

HANNAH & KEVIN J  
~And it’s somehow like we’re stuck here  
~At a messed up costume party

DIANE & KEVIN T  
~And there’s nothing here familiar

HANNAH & KEVIN J

JANICE  
By the middle of the day on Wednesday, I’m coordinating menus for 7,000 people.  
(starts reporting)  
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rotary Club is looking for some fish dishes. And we have a bunch of German passengers down at the Moose Club who'd like to try elk... No, sorry. That's the Elk's Club that's looking for moose. Sorry, I'm new.

BEULAH  
Well if you won't try cod tongue, we got cheeseburgers - or we got hot dogs too — and there's tuna casserole over there — or I could make you up a bologna sandwich?

KEVIN J  
(to KEVIN T)  
Are there vegetables in Canada?

KEVIN T  
(to BEULAH)  
We're vegetarians.

KEVIN J  
I converted him.

KEVIN T  
Anyway, I notice this other passenger who hasn’t eaten anything at all —

KEVIN J  
Kevin's suddenly in everyone else’s business.

KEVIN T  
So, I notify our hosts.

RABBI (ACTOR 7)  
No. No, thank you. Please. I’m fine.

BEULAH  
Turns out he’s an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi and he only eats Kosher food. Now, we have all kinds of people living in Newfoundland: Protestants, Baptists, Catholics, Salvation Army-ists — but not a lot of Jewish people.

RABBI  
The next thing I know, I’m set up in the faculty lounge, making a Kosher kitchen for any other Jewish passengers — but also for two Hindu women, some Muslims.

KEVIN T  
And a couple vegetarians.

.Scene 20

ANNETTE  
One of the pilots for Virgin Atlantic — Captain Bristol —

# Song 7a: Captain Bristol

He's a very strong leader. He's good to his passengers. And he's handsome too.  
Anyway, he takes me aside and he says...

CAPTAIN BRISTOL (ACTOR 10)  
(over the top romantic)  
I've been watching you — you're doing beautiful work. I'd like you to be my personal liaison and... work closely with me, helping to handle anything I might need.

BEULAH  
Annette — what’ya on about? He did not say that.

ANNETTE  
Well, he said something like that.

ALI approaches BEULAH, holding a bowl.

ALI  
Miss Beulah? Hello.

BEULAH  
(caught off guard)  
Ah! ...Hello, Ali.

ALI  
May I ask? This food. What is it?

BEULAH  
(simply)  
That's called Cod au Gratin.  
Fish with cheese. It’s fish. With cheese.

She walks away.

ALI  
(calling after her)  
...Are you sure I cannot help you with the food?

CLAUDE  
People start taking passengers back to their houses to get cleaned up and then inviting them to dinner — and then putting them up in their guest rooms.

MARTHA (ACTOR 5)  
Look, Misses. I’m just 20 weeks along and my Terry’s already set up the nursery, you and your little one will be much more comfortable there.

BRITNEY (ACTOR 3)  
Thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart. Would you like to come back to my house for a shower?

BOB  
People are saying ‘we want you to come to our house’. And I think, what is up with this? I mean, are they charging for these “free” showers? Or are they gonna go all Norman Bates... Anyway, I wasn’t falling for it. But finally, I’m invited back to the Mayor of Appleton’s house — that sounds fancy, but it’s not — there’s a mayor for every town of a thousand people in Newfoundland. There’s the Mayor of Gander (he points to CLAUDE).  
There’s the Mayor of Lewisporte (CLAUDE puts on glasses).  
There’s the Mayor of Gambo (CLAUDE puts on a moustache).  
Anyway, I’m staying with the Mayor of Appleton.  
(CLAUDE puts on a hat, becoming DERM.)

DERM  
Come on in, son. The Irish Whiskey’s in the bar downstairs.

BOB  
His wife shows me where my bedroom is and where the shower is and through it all, I keep thinking — where am I going to leave my wallet? Someone is gonna steal my wallet.

KEVIN J  
Someone says there’s a way out of here. They say there might be a boat —

KEVIN T  
Kevin, we’re on the other side of the continent. We’re not taking a boat.

KEVIN J  
So I stop an officer and ask him, “How do I get back home?”

BOB  
Yeah, how do we get out of here?

OZ  
(quickly)  
Well, you take a taxi to The Goose — there’s a bus there to Port Aux Basque, leaves once a day, that’s about six hours. Once you're there, you take the ferry across the Gulf, right? That's eight hours or so, then you catch another bus, not sure how often they leave, but it’s another eight hours to Yarmouth where you can get another ferry to the US Border, that's another four hours or so — and from Bar Harbor you should be able to grab a Greyhound to wherever you need to go.  
It’s about 2 or 3 days travel. But it’s sure a nice view.

.Scene 21

BEVERLEY  
I don’t leave the hotel. I wait by the phone. Wait for someone to tell me we can fly again. Planes aren’t made to just sit on the tarmac — planes are made to be in constant motion. They arrive, you switch crew, you switch passengers, you empty the honey buckets, and then the plane keeps going. When they sit still for too long, well, it’s not good for ‘em. They start to break down.

# Song 7b: It's Sure a Nice View

DIANE  
Our pilot says we’re not leaving anytime soon, and Nick says...

NICK  
I might get a picture or two before we go.

KEVIN T  
I finally convince Kevin to go for a walk.

KEVIN J  
There’s four of us to begin with. This Texan woman and this English guy with a disposable camera and a huge stick up his ass.

KEVIN T  
They’re nice enough...  
(pointing at KEVIN)  
Kevin and I are a little wary of telling people we’re together.

KEVIN J  
I mean you just don’t know how redneck people can be.

DIANE  
(happily)  
This nice gay couple come along with us.

NICK  
We kind of make small talk. They ask me what I do.

KEVIN J  
He works for this oil company in England and she was there visiting with her son.

NICK  
Wait... You've got a son?

DIANE  
Yes. David. The one who was flying on Tuesday.

KEVIN J  
She goes on and on about England and how she didn’t get to travel when she was married.

NICK  
Wait... You're divorced?

DIANE  
Yes. For a long time now.

KEVIN T  
(to Nick)  
What about you?

NICK  
No. Not divorced, I mean... Not that I’m married! I’m neither. I travel a lot for work —

KEVIN T  
Kevin and I work for an environmental energy company. It’s my company — and Kevin’s my secretary.

KEVIN J  
I’m his secretary.

KEVIN T  
Anyway — we do a lot of green work, so we generally hate people who work in oil.

NICK  
I just got the feeling that they hated me.

DIANE  
Then they want to go into some old building that looks like a shed. Now, they'd heard it was a bar, but I wasn’t going into a bar in the middle of the afternoon with three men I had just met.

NICK  
And I think, I'll stay with Diane, you know, instead of the gay men who hate me.

THEY exit in opposite directions.

# Song 7c: World's Largest Refrigerator

In an airplane hangar, BONNIE is feeding animals, as DOUG gets increasingly frustrated.

BONNIE  
Doug's helping me feed the animals — and after security checks each plane — slow as cold molasses — we finally find eight dogs, nine cats — one of whom's epileptic — not to mention two rare Bonobo chimpanzees! And the female Bonobo is pregnant.  
We've got to get them off these planes!  
(into the phone)  
Hello? Is the Mayor there? It’s Bonnie Harris again. Yes, I'll hold.

DOUG  
FAA was pretty clear about “No rare chimpanzees on Canadian soil.”

BONNIE hands a bucket to DOUG.

BONNIE  
What is that?

DOUG  
It’s rare chimpanzee shit. What do you think it is?  
(into the phone)  
Yes? The mayor! Yes! I'll hold!

DOUG  
(finally losing his patience)  
I've got to get back to Air Traffic Control!

BONNIE  
Doug — look up! Do you see anything flying?

DOUG  
I can't see across the friggin' Atlantic!

BONNIE  
Just get me more litter from the truck!

DOUG  
Get your own litter!

DOUG exits.

BONNIE  
Fine then! Goodbye!  
(into the phone)  
No! Not you! Hello? Hello?!

STAFF 6  
Health Canada says all this food needs refrigeration, but we’ve got nowhere to store it — none of the shelters are equipped for this!

STAFF 1  
We're getting three more truckloads of food tonight —

STAFF 8  
Stop them! We've got nowhere to put it!

STAFF 7  
Well, then what do we feed people?

STAFF 6  
You need to talk to Health Canada

STAFF 8  
Well cancel the effing food too!

STAFF 12  
Don't look at me! It's not my decision!

STAFF 4  
Now there's five vats of chilli. My uncle has a truck

STAFF 1  
That Rogers girl does NOT know what she's doing.

STAFF 2  
Until further notice? What does that mean?

STAFF 12  
We also need that girl at Rogers to announce that rotary, hockey, boys and girls club — everything’s cancelled until further notice.

CLAUDE  
Hold on. Did you just say that Hockey's cancelled?

A pause.

JANICE  
3:47pm — The town is asking all bulk food deliveries be taken to the Gander community center hockey rink. Since hockey’s cancelled, the Mayor is now calling it...

CLAUDE  
The world’s largest walk-in refrigerator!

# Song 7d: Bar and Grills

In Gambo, KEVIN T and KEVIN J are at the bar.

KEVIN T  
It’s hot outside, so we stay in the bar, and make small talk with Matty, the owner, and his wife, Brenda—

KEVIN J  
We're not sure how much to say — you just don't know where the red states are in a foreign country, right?

KEVIN T  
But we'd been drinking all afternoon and I accidentally say something like, Kevin and I have been together for almost five years...

KEVIN J  
(quickly)  
In business. We've been together in business. I’m his secretary — His secretary!

The music stops as EVERYONE looks at them.

KEVIN T  
And it feels like the entire bar goes silent —

KEVIN J  
And I’m like... Oh, god.

KEVIN T  
And then Matty says...

MATTY (ACTOR 7)  
You're gay?

KEVIN J  
And I’m about to pass out.  
But then Matty says...

KEVIN T  
Well, praise be to God. My daughter’s gay!

MATTY  
And then Brenda says...

BRENDA (ACTOR 1)  
Sure, my sister’s gay — and the woman across the road just ran off with her best friend!

KEVIN T  
And then Brenda’s brother says...

BRENDA’S BROTHER (ACTOR 11)  
Our uncle is 68 years old and he just told us he’s a bi-sexual.

KEVIN T  
We somehow ended up in the gayest town in Newfoundland. And Kevin and I are looking at each other like — I think I even say, “There must be something in the water.” And then Brenda’s brother says...

BRENDA’S BROTHER  
That's why I only drink the beer.

.Scene 25

BOB  
Watching the news all day, some of us are starting to lose it. So these people here, they decide to have a big cook out for the whole community — just trying to get our minds off of everything. And Derm, the Mayor of Appleton, says to me...

DERM  
Right, m’son, do me a favor and start to round up some grills.

BOB  
Round up some grills?

DERM  
Yeah, just go to people’s yards and take their grills.

A pause.

BOB  
... Take their grills? Someone’s gonna shoot me.

DERM  
No, no, no, no, no... Just go to people’s yards and grab their grill.

Another pause.

BOB  
(to audience)  
So I'm going from yard to yard and I keep thinking, someone is going to shoot me in the back.

MALE TOWNSPERSON (ACTOR 12)  
Hello there!

BOB freezes.

Are you taking my barbecue?

BOB  
... This is your barbecue?

MALE TOWNSPERSON  
Yeah, buddy.

BOB  
Listen, I am so sorry —

MALE TOWNSPERSON  
The wife’s got the kettle on, if you want a cuppa.

BOB  
I get offered a cup a tea in every single backyard — and most of them offer to help me steal their own barbecues. We bring them all over to the community center — no names on them. I don’t know how they ever get ‘em back. But that’s how we have a big cookout — completely free. After that I stop worrying so much about my wallet.

JANICE  
8:45 am.

ALL  
~Thursday.

JANICE  
September 13th. We've got a... situation down at Gander Academy.

At the Academy, BEULAH and ANNETTE address everyone.

BEULAH  
Ladies and Gentlemen. We have an indelicate request. We need volunteers to help clean the bathrooms. As you can imagine, with 700 adults in a primary school... Health Canada needs us to clean them every hour and a half and we just don’t have the people. So, we're asking for your help.

A pause as EVERYONE looks away.

ANNETTE  
But no one volunteers.

BEULAH  
No one comes. And we’re run off our feet with everything else. And then—

# Song 7e: Cardiologists

ANNETTE  
Sweet Jesus in the garden.

This line of men comes walking down the hall.

Six men in doctor coats walk towards her in a slow motion burlesque. ANNETTE’s jaw drops.

The top six cardiologists from all over the world. On their way to a conference.  
Highly qualified cardiologists.  
And they know about the importance of cleanliness.

CARDIOLOGIST (ACTOR 7)  
If we don’t get these bathrooms clean, we’re going to have... bigger problems.

The CARDIOLOGISTS exit.

.Scene 26

# Song 7f: I Am Here

BEULAH  
Anyway I get lunch set up, labeling anything that'll go bad with the date and time, I let the pants out for one of the pilots who’s been enjoying our cooking. I make a balloon animal for a crying toddler — and then I check on Hannah, talking to anyone she can reach.

On the other side of the stage, HANNAH puts the phone to her ear.

HANNAH  
~I am here — I am here on an island  
~Hello? Hello. It’s me again  
~Yeah, my son. He’s with Rescue Two  
~Any news?  
~I am his mother  
~I’m far away — stuck here

~Fine — I’ll hold again  
~I should be down there

She leaves message after message for her son— until there’s no more room on his
answering machine.
HANNAH
ALL I KNOW
IS YOU ARE THERE
YOU ARE THERE
AND 1 AM HERE
BEULAH
She finally got some news.
HANNAH
They said it was Kev's day off — but someone else said there were more men down
there than were scheduled.
I should be looking for him. He's always there for me — trying to make me laugh.
Tells me stupid jokes. He loves jokes — tells them to the kids at the firehouse, while
he fixes their bikes.
I should be there.
BEULAH
I know there’s nothing I can do to help. But I do know a few jokes. There was a
sailor who was stationed in the South Pacific, far away from his wife who he'd just
married. And when he was away, he wrote her a letter. He said, “We're going to be
apart for a long time —and this island is full of young, attractive native girls. I need
something to take my mind off them.”
So his wife sends him an accordion and says, “Why don’t you learn to play this
then?” So finally, he comes home from his tour of duty and says to his wife, “I can’t
wait to get you into bed.” And she says, “First let’s see how well you play that
accordion.”
SHE laughs at her own joke, but sees HANNAH 's face and stops.
[[Page 73]]
HANNAH
That was a really stupid joke.
A pause.
Tell me another one.
[[Page 74]]

.Scene 27

KEVIN T
Everywhere you look, there are people from around the globe. Going back and forth for phones — or showers. Grabbing something from Shoppers. I’m getting coffee at a gas station on the main drag —and suddenly the entire place goes quiet...

# Song 72: Before Prayer

EVERYONE on stage stands still. KEVIN turns around, looking.

And nobody moves. Even the people outside are standing still. And I look up at the TVs and realize —it’s a national moment of silence in America. And all of these Newfoundlanders—these people from another country—they maintain that moment of silence. I don’t know if that would happen back home—at a busy gas station on the main drag—but it happened here.

HANNAH
Beulah walks me to church—and when we get there, I light a candle for my son.

BEULAH
And I do too.

KEVIN T
I suddenly realized what that music was from my dream —it was an old hymn from when I was a kid. Now, I haven’t been to church in years, but for some reason that song was in my head.

~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there is hatred, let me bring your love,
~Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,
~And where there's doubt true faith in you.

HANNAH
~Make me a channel of your peace

KEVIN T
~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there's despair in life,
~Let me bring hope, where there's despair in life,
~Let me bring hope
~Where there is darkness,
~Only light, where there is darkness,
~Only light,
~And where there's sadness,
~Ever joy, ever joy

RABBI
~Oseh shalom bim’romav
~Hu ya’aseh shalom aleinu
~V'al kol Yisrael
~V'imru, v'imru amen

There is a man here in town. He’s lived here nearly his entire life. He heard that there was a Rabbi diverted here and he came to find me and tell me his story.

EDDIE (ACTOR 11)
I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents—they were Jews—they sent me here before the war started. I still remember some prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was told I should never tell anyone that I was Jewish—even my wife. But after what happened on Tuesday—so many stories gone—just like that. I needed to tell someone.

ALI (ACTOR 9)
During El-Fajr, when most people are asleep it is easier to pray. But at El-Dhuhr, I can feel them watching me. Sometimes I catch them when they think I’m not looking—and I can see the fear in their eyes.

ANNETTE
Excuse me? Beulah wanted me to check on you. The library’s open—for anyone looking for some peace—and a quiet place to pray.

ALI lays out a prayer mat and begins to pray.

RABBI & EDDIE (hesitantly)
~Ya'aseh shalom (ya’aseh)
~Ya'aseh shalom (shalom)
~Shalom aleinu v'al kol Yisrael
~Ya'aseh shalom (ya’aseh)
~Ya'aseh shalom (shalom)
~Shalom aleinu v'al kol Yisrael

BEULAH, HANNAH, JEWISH PASSENGERS, HINDU PASSENGERS, KEVIN T & SINGER 10
~O master, grant that oseh shalom bim’romav asato maa
~I may never seek hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu sad-gamaya
~So much to be v'ial kol Yisrael tamaso maa
~Consoled as to vimru amen jyotire-gamaya
~Console; passengers 1 & 6 mrityor-maa—
~To be understood as ya’aseh shalom mritan gamaya
~To understand, ya’aseh shalom om shaantih
~To be loved, as to ya'aseh shalom shalom shaantih
~Love with all my soul shaantih

Underneath the above prayers, ALI prays.

ALI
Allahu Akbar

ALI stands with hands at ears, bends over with hands on knees, on his knees.

ALI
Subbhaan Rabbi al Azeem

He puts his head down.

ALI
Allahu Akbar

He comes back up to kneeling. He puts his head down.

ALI
Subhaan Rabbia Al-Aala’

He comes back up to kneeling. He puts his head to the right then to the left. Stands and folds his prayer rug.

KEVIN T
~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope
~Where there is darkness, only light
~And where there’s sadness, ever joy

# Song 8a: Bonnie in the Holds

BONNIE
Health Canada finally lets the animals off and quarantines them to Hangar One. It’s a big room with cats and dogs and chimpanzees and there’s barking, meowing — and then the chimps start imitating the dogs, and they're barking too. The phones are ringing off the hook with people, who want to see their pets... But they're not allowed anywhere near the planes.

BONNIE
And I'm worried about Unga, the pregnant Bonobo. All animals are affected badly by stress - not just humans.

I interview a woman from Queens—a mother. Her son is a firefighter and they still can’t account for him. She starts crying and I start crying too. And I can’t stop shaking. I don't know if I can do this anymore.

BEVERLEY
I check in with Air Traffic Control again and it’s more bad news. Not only is the airspace still closed, but there’s a storm headed for Newfoundland. Hurricane Erin is making landfall by tomorrow or the day after. If we don’t get these planes in the air soon, no one’s going anywhere.

OZ
Claude, people are starting to crack.

CLAUDE
Let’s get everyone down to the Legion.

KEVIN T
Everyone’s going down to the Legion for a drink.

KEVIN J
Hi, have you seen my boyfriend? His name is Kevin, he’s about that tall, and he’s lost his mind.

KEVIN T
I just want to go out!

KEVIN J
Well, I don’t!

KEVIN T
Well, I'm not going without you.

KEVIN J
Well, I’m not... staying for a long time.

KEVIN T
One drink!

KEVIN J
One drink!

KEVIN T drags KEVIN J out the door.

BEULAH
Hannah? Everyone’s going out tonight.

HANNAH
You go on without me, Beulah... I need to wait by the phone.

BEULAH
I'll wait with you.

BEVERLEY
I keep waiting to hear from the airline. So I'll just be here by the phone, Tom, if the kids want to speak with me.

DOUG
Bonnie? I know you're not leaving the animals, so I brought you some chili. But I really think that tonight, you should come home and get some sleep...

BONNIE runs on.

BONNIE
Doug! Oh my—Get in here! We are about to have the first rare Bonobo chimpanzee born in Newfoundland!

OZ
Beulah! They need some food down at the Legion if you can spare any.

ALI
Miss Beulah. Please let me help with the food.

BEULAH
No, m’love. You're a guest—

ALI
Please. I am a master chef for an international hotel chain. I oversee restaurants around the world. I would like to help with the food.

BEULAH
Get in there!

BEULAH gestures emphatically toward the kitchen as ALI runs in, exasperated.

DIANE
Everyone’s going out to the bar—and Nick is going.

NICK
I'm going if Diane is going.

DIANE
And I think, nobody here knows me—I can be whoever I want to be...

BOB
I’m not worried about my wallet. I’m not worried about getting shot. I am a little worried about how much Irish Whiskey I'm drinking...

EVERYONE enters at the bar excitedly.



.Scene 30

OZ
By eight o’clock the bar is completely packed with people from around the world. Everybody’s talking about where they’re staying and what they've seen—and the bar staff keep making runs for more beer and liquor. After an hour, people are swimming in the river out back. And no, no one brought their swim trunks!
A couple of the local b’ys get up with their accordions and fiddles—and someone brings out an ugly stick.

A brief ugly stick solo & fiddle solo.

MEN
~Farewell to all you pretty ladies
~Waving from the dock
~Heave away, me jollies, heave away
~And if we do return to you
~We'll make your cradles rock
~Heave away, me jolly boys, we're all bound away

WOMEN
~Farewell you Newfoundlander boys
~You're leaving us alone
~Heave away, me jollies, heave away
~And if you find another
~We've got lovers of our own

ALL
~Heave away, me jolly boys, we're all bound away

OZ
And then we get the karaoke going.

DELORES
~Near... far...

ALL
~Wherever we are!

EVERYONE cheers.

OZ
Then we decide to have a bit of a ceremony.

CLAUDE
Let’s make these people honorary Newfoundlanders!

# Song 10: Screech In

(CLAUDE)
~Now there's a solemn, old tradition
~For admission — or audition —to transition
~From a come from away

ALL
~To be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~The only other way at any rate
~Is pass away and pray to fate and wait
~To reincarnate

ALL
~As a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey - come on inside
~Nothing ventured nothing tried

ACTOR 5
~Only a couple people cried

ALL
~You'll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey —sit down right here
~You'll feel better in a year

ACTOR 7
~Try to ignore your doubts and fears

ALL
~And you'll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
Now we needs a couple volunteers! Who wants to become a Newfoundlander?
Right here!

CLAUDE
Good man! Who else?

KEVIN T
I have no idea why I put up my hand. Kevin’s like...

KEVIN J
Oh my god are you serious?

KEVIN T tries to dance a jig.
Oh my god — you are serious.

KEVIN T
Yes—I’m serious. Don’t do it if you don’t want to.

KEVIN J
I won't.

CLAUDE
Where you from, Buddy?

KEVIN T
Los Angeles.

CLAUDE
LA! Who else?

DIANE
Us!

NICK DIANE
Actually, I’m not sure I don’t like performing... We want to be Newfoundlanders!

CLAUDE
Alright, then. Where are you folks from?

DIANE
Texas and —

CLAUDE
Texas!
(to NICK)
What part of Texas are you from, buddy?

NICK DIANE
No. I’m from — No! I’M from Texas. He’s from (like the Queen) "England."
Well, wait. Now how does that work?

CLAUDE
NICK
How does what work?

CLAUDE
How does your marriage work with you being in England and her in Texas?

NICK DIANE
No— No—we're not married.

CLAUDE
Oh, I’m sorry - I just assumed you were married... Well, would you like to be?

NICK DIANE
Ah— Well, why not?!

NICK
Diane had had two beers by then, so it was probably the alcohol talking.

DIANE
I’ve never had more than one beer at a time before, so it was probably the alcohol talking.

NICK
I went and got her two more beers.

CLAUDE
~Now the first part is the easiest
~We'll soon get to the queasiest
~I'll need you to repeat this mess

ALL
~When you become a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~'Cause we speaks a different language, son
~We adds some esses and some rum
~You'll have to try a good cod tongue

ALL
~When you become a Newfoundlander

CHORUS
~Hey hey —just do your best
~Nothing scary - nothing yet

ACTOR 3
~You'll have to change the way you’re dressed

THEY put Sou’wester hats on each screechee.

ALL
~And you’ll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey - just sing along
~Nothing ventured just prolonged

CLAUDE
~There's thirty verses in this song

ALL
~Then you'll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
(holding a bottle)
Ladies and Gentlemen. This is Screech. Back in World War 2, an officer was stationed here and was offered some of this stuff. All the locals were tossing it back with nar’ a quiver, so he does too, and lets out an ear-piecing...

CLAUDE and all the LOCALS howl.

Everybody comes to see what's happened and says —

ALL Except SCREECHEES
“What was that ungodly screech?!”

CLAUDE
And now it’s your turn. Are you ready?

NICK DIANE BOB KEVIN T
Um... I’m not sure that — Wait — did you just say — No. Nope. Not really ready. Do we have to drink this?

CLAUDE
Good! All together now. One!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
ONE!

CLAUDE
Two!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
TWO!

CLAUDE
Three!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
THREE!

CLAUDE
Down the hatch!

EVERYONE cheers as THEY drink. BOB howls. NICK grimaces. KEVIN T shakes his head. DIANE taps her glass, getting every drop out.

KEVIN T
Screech is basically bad Jamaican rum.

NICK
Screech is horrific.

DIANE
Screech is delishush!

BOB
And then they brought the Cod.

KEVIN T
The Cod.

NICK
The Cod.

DIANE
The Cod.

A codfish is brought out and handed to CLAUDE.

CLAUDE
~Now with every transformation
~Comes a tiny bit of risk
~You've got to walk the plank
~And there’ll be blood or there’ll be bliss
~And it’s the same to be a Newfoundlander
~Every person's wish
~So don’t be dumb
~Just take the plunge
~And go on— kiss the fish!

NEWFOUNDLANDERS
(continued underneath, building steadily)
~I'm an islander—I am an islander
~I'm an islander—I am an islander...

CLAUDE
Ladies and gentlemen —this is a genuine freshly caught Newfoundland Cod —and if you want to become an honorary Newfoundlander, you'll have to give her a smooch!
One!

BOB kisses the fish and cheers.

KEVIN J
If you kiss that, I will never kiss you again!

KEVIN T
I'll risk it!
Two!

KEVIN T kisses the fish.

CLAUDE
NICK
I'm not kissing a fish!
Come on, I will if you will!

DIANE
NICK
Oh, my god. Fine.

NICK kisses the fish and grimaces.

DIANE
Oh, God. I can’t do it.

NICK
What? I just did!

CLAUDE
Now you gotta kiss the cod—it’s a vital part of the ceremony.

DIANE
No! I can’t do it!

CLAUDE
Alright —look here. I'll make you a deal. Either you kiss this fish —or else you kiss this Englishman that you're not married to.

NICK
Wait.... what?

DIANE
Okay.

DIANE kisses him.

ALL
~Hey hey —come on tonight
~Take a risk and take a ride
~Jump right in with both feet tied
~And you'll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey —come on once more
~Nothing ventured, nothing sore
~After it’s over, out the door
~And you’ll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~After it’s over you’ll remember

ALL
~That you’re a Newfoundlander

# Song 10a: After Screech

The band kicks in again, as EVERYONE trails out of the bar.

CLAUDE
Good job L.A.!

OZ
Goodnight now!

KEVIN T
Kevin? Where'd you go? Kevin?

.Scene 31

BEVERLEY sits alone in her hotel room, wide-awake.

# Song 11: Me and the Sky

BEVERLEY
~My parents must have thought
~They had a crazy kid
~Cause I was one of those kids
~Who always knew what I wanted
~They took me down to the airport
~To see all the planes departing
~Watching them fly something inside of me was starting
~I was eight when I told them
~That I'd be a pilot
~But I was too young and too short
~And there were no female captains
~And my dad said be patient
~He said just see what happens
~But I took my first lesson
~Came down from the sky and
~Told my father I'd fly for the rest of my life
~And I got my first job
~Flying for a mortician
~In a tiny Bonanza
~Just a corpse and me
~Five dollars an hour
~For flying dead bodies
~I had to climb over their faces
~Just to get to my seat
~And suddenly the wheels lift off
~The ground is falling backwards
~I am suddenly alive

(BEVERLEY)
~Suddenly I’m in the cockpit
~Suddenly everything’s changed
~Suddenly I'm not too young or too short
~And the passengers in the back don’t complain
~Suddenly I’m flying company charters
~Suddenly everything's high
~Suddenly there’s nothing in between
~Me and the sky
~American Airlines
~Had the prettiest planes
~So I applied as a flight engineer
~But the World War 2 pilots, they all complained
~They said, “Girls shouldn't be in the cockpit ~ hey lady, hey baby,
~Hey, why don’t you grab us a drink?”
~And the flight attendants weren't my friends back then
~And they said, “Are you better than us, do you think?”
~But I kept getting hired and
~The World War 2 crew - they retired and
~The girls all thought much higher of me

The women become FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, clapping, singing backup.

~1986 - the first female American captain in history
~Suddenly I’m in the cockpit
~Suddenly I've got my wings
~Suddenly all of those pilots protesting me
~Well they can get their own drinks!
~Suddenly there’s no one saying stay grounded
~Looking down - passing them by
~Suddenly there’s nothing in between
~Me and the sky
~Suddenly I’ve got an all female crew
~The news caught and made headlines across the world
~Suddenly it stopped, no-one’s saying

BEVERLEY (With FLIGHT ATTENDANTS)
~(You can’t) or (you won't)
~Or you know you’re not anything (cause you’re a girl)

BEVERLEY
~Suddenly I'm getting married
~And we're putting pins on a map where we've flown
~Suddenly I am a mother
~And suddenly shocked at how much they’ve grown
~Suddenly I’m wond’ring how my parents would feel
~Seeing me teaching men to be pilots
~Cause suddenly I am a senior instructor
~And somehow I’m fifty-one
~Suddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas,
~Across the Atlantic, and feeling calm
~When suddenly someone on air-to-air traffic says,
~At 8:46 there’s been a terrorist action
~And the one thing I loved more than anything
~Was used as the bomb
~Suddenly I'm in a hotel
~Suddenly something has died
~Suddenly there's something in between
~Me and the...

BEVERLEY answers the phone.

Hello?
I’m on my way.

# Song 11a: Departures

JANICE
1:34am

ALL
Friday.

JANICE
September 14th. Shelters will be alerted as each plane is cleared to go.

BOB
Our pilot says to pack up. It’s sudden notice —the middle of the night—and we're leaving in an hour. But these people — they make these bag lunches—and they form a... a gauntlet — handing them out—and we all walk through it and get our lunches and say goodbye to all of them. We try to give them money, but they won't take it.

DERM
No, m’son. You would’ve done the same.

BOB
I drank all your whiskey.

DERM
I would’ve done the same.

BOB and DERM hug.



.Scene 33

The next morning, DIANE wakes up, hungover.

NICK
Good morning.

DIANE
Nnnnnnn.

NICK
You were snoring.
My head hurts.
You had a couple.

DIANE
Did I kiss the fish?

(He looks at her, surprised.)

NICK
Don’t you—? ...Yes, you did.

DIANE
Oh good... Wait—

NICK
We’re running out of time. Our plane could be the next one to go.

(KEVIN T turns to KEVIN J.)

KEVIN T
Our plane could be the next one to go. ...Are you still upset that I kissed a fish?

KEVIN J
No. I’m upset that I left the bar and you didn’t even notice!

KEVIN T
You left without telling me—

KEVIN J
After everything that’s happened. You're out there acting like it’s okay. And it’s not okay.

KEVIN T
I know. But I’m not gonna shut myself inside. Let’s just get back to LA.

DIANE
While you’re in Dallas, I’d love to have you over.

KEVIN J
I tried to change my flight to New York. They wouldn’t do it.

NICK
My conference was cancelled. So, I head back to London immediately.

KEVIN T
I don’t understand. Why would you...?

KEVIN J
I just need to be back home.

NICK
Back home.

DIANE
Back home.

KEVIN T
Back home.

(All four are silent.)

NICK
(sadly)
Well. All good things, right?

.Scene 34

BEULAH
As the plane people leave, they keep stopping us, thanking us, trying to give us money, but we say...

OZ
No, buddy. You would’ve done the same.

ANNETTE
But one guy keeps insisting till Beulah finally tells him...

BEULAH
Look, you can slip it in the suggestion box down at Town Hall, but honestly, we’re happy with a thank you on your way out.

ANNETTE
Captain Bristol—that pilot for Virgin Atlantic. He comes to find me to help him round up his passengers.

CAPTAIN BRISTOL
(over the top romantic)
Annette—my darling—Before I leave, I need to thank you for... everything we've shared. Though I travel home today, I leave my heart behind.

(ANNETTE salutes him.)

ANNETTE
Don’t.
(stopping her from saying anything else)
Blablablablablaba—

(All of the LOCALS overlap saying goodbye.)

LOCAL 1
Goodbye! I'll miss you!

LOCAL 2
Tell us when the baby's born!

LOCAL 3
I'll be waiting by the phone.

BEULAH
Let us know you made it home safe!

LOCAL 5
Goodbye! Take care now!

ANNETTE
Don’t be a stranger.

OZ
Don’t forget us now!

LOCAL 8
Thank you for the bottle of wine!

LOCAL 9
You write us now!

LOCAL 11
Goodbye!

LOCAL 12

(A beat. All the LOCALS slump with a sigh, exhausted.)

BOB
We get down to the airport—and it's chaos. Passengers dropped off from multiple flights. Every bag has to be emptied.

OZ
No scissors. No nail clippers. If any bags are unidentified, they'll be blown up.

BOB
Then, someone says there’s issues with security.

(BEVERLEY steps forward.)

BEVERLEY
One of my flight attendants comes to find me. She says...

(The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.)

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
There’s a Muslim man on our flight—

(ALI steps forward.)
I saw him praying—and... he’s been acting... suspicious. He doesn’t have a carry-on... I'm not getting back on that plane with him.

ALI
I arrive at the airport and am pulled out of line.

BEVERLEY
I am responsible for the safety of my passengers and my crew. And security tells me any perceived threats must be taken extremely seriously.

They bring me to a private room and he is brought in for questioning.

ALI
At first I do not understand what the police are asking. And then I do.
In my culture, there is a word—“awrah”—the area between your stomach and your knees. It is forbidden in my religion for anyone to see this but my wife.
To have a woman in the room, watching this. Watching me. You can’t understand.

BEVERLEY
It is the most thorough body search I’ve ever witnessed. And when it’s over, I find him and I tell him—I am so very sorry that happened.

ALI
(barely looking at her)
Am I free to go now?

(BEVERLEY nods.)

ACTOR 11
When are we leaving?!

(The CROWD jumps in with questions about leaving, pulling BEVERLEY away.)



.Scene 35

BEVERLEY addresses her passengers.

BEVERLEY
Good morning. We are one of the first flights to leave...
The CROWD responds, relieved.
...which makes us one of the lucky ones as some planes may still be here for quite some time. Now, I have no control over this. You’ve paid for a flight from Paris to Dallas. If I get clearance, I will take you to Dallas. But if I am not cleared for Dallas, I have to take y’all back to France.
The CROWD starts murmuring.
But we will make arrangements as quickly as we can to get y’all back to the United States where you need to be.

CROWD 5
I can’t go back. I just adopted my daughter — we could lose her if we go back to Europe...

CROWD 5 ^
I could lose my daughter.

CROWD 10 ^
America is at war! I’m not going back to France.

KEVIN J ^
We've been here four days! How long are we going to be here?

KEVIN T ^
You have to take us home!

CROWD 12 ^
You said yourself — we paid for a ticket to Dallas — that’s where we should be taken.

CROWD 5 ^
We were trapped on our plane forever and then we've been here for days with no information and now you—what is wrong with you?

CROWD 10 ^
What is wrong with you? This is an International tragedy!

KEVIN J ^
Hey. Calm down. I’m sure they’re doing the best they can. If she says they’re going to get us home, then they’re going to get us home.

CROWD 11
Hey! Hey! We can vote on this. We can make them go where we want to go.

CROWD 11 ^
There’s over 200 of us—they'll take us where the majority of us wants to go. I'm serious — Hey. Hey!

CROWD 5
Well, who's for Dallas?

CROWD 11
Fuck that! Who’s for Switzerland?!

BEVERLEY
This is not a democracy! I am the captain and this is coming from American Airlines and the FAA. You are not voting on our destination. Now, if we have any situation that needs to be dealt with, we will be pulled out of line and we will be the last flight to leave.
The CROWD is quiet.
Thank you for your cooperation.

HANNAH
After hours of waiting, they tell us we're not leaving yet after all.

JANICE
4:18pm. There’s a 747 with a flat tire blocking the runway.
The PASSENGERS react to the news, groaning.
All planes are stopped. No one’s taking off.

# Song 11b: Dover Fault

All of the LOCALS jump up, still exhausted and surprised.

LOCAL 1
Hello! Welcome back.

LOCAL 2
I'll get your room ready.

BEULAH
I'll put the kettle on.

LOCAL 5
Welcome back. Come on in!

LOCAL 6 ^
Did you forget something?

LOCAL 8 ^
You've missed us.

LOCAL 9 ^
Get in here!

LOCAL 10 ^
Come on in!

LOCAL 11 ^
Hello! Hello! That was fast.

LOCAL 2 ^
You must've missed us. Come on in!

.Scene 36

DIANE
We're told by our pilot to stay close to our shelters so we're ready to go again.

NICK
But Diane wants to take one last look around. And I can’t let her go by herself.

DIANE
And we find a gorgeous lookout: the Dover Fault.

DIANE stands on a chair and looks out.

NICK
(exhausted)
There’s about a million stairs.

DIANE
It’s beautiful. Nick! You've gotta see this.

HE steps up next to her and looks.

NICK
(looking)
Wow...

DIANE
I can’t believe we're here.

NICK
I know.

DIANE
I can’t believe we're leaving!

NICK
(quietly)
I don’t want to go.

DIANE
What did you say?

NICK
I don’t know. I'm—I'm going to get a picture or two.

DIANE
Oh, okay.

# Song 12: Stop the World

NICK turns to take a picture of her - and DIANE freezes.

NICK
~Stop the world
~Take a picture
~Try to capture
~To ensure this moment lasts
~We’re still in it
~But in a minute
~That’s the limit
~And this present will be past
~So here we are
~Where the world has come together
~So here she'll be
~In this picture forever

DIANE unfreezes.

DIANE
Look at this: Five hundred and forty million years ago, the continents of the world crashed together right here. And two hundred million years ago, they separated again, moving apart from each other.

NICK
Huh,

DIANE
But a little part of them was left behind.

NICK lifts his camera, pointing it at her.

DIANE
I should move. You’re missing all the scenery —

NICK
No, no. Stay where you are.

DIANE
Really?

NICK
Really. It’s perfect.

HE takes another picture and this time NICK freezes.

DIANE
~Stop the world
~Seize the moment
~But the minute he goes
~You're alone and it’s through
~Pinch yourself
~Tell yourself
~You’re just dreaming
~That means he’ll forget about you
~But here we are
~Where the continents once crashed together
~Before they went
~Their separate ways forever, so

DIANE (& NICK)
~Stop the world (stop the world)
~Stop the world (stop the world)
~Stop the world from spinning round

EVERYONE ELSE begins to sing underneath.

NICK & DIANE
~I'm on a lookout
~Overlooking something
~Worth taking the time
~To stop flying by
~And look down
~And look down
~Stop the world
~Stop being scared
~And look round
~And look round
~Stop the world
~Just tell her/him now and
~Aah
~Look now
~Aah!

DIANE & NICK
~Take a picture of the scenery
~Of a lookout
~Of a moment which is over
~Of the ocean of the river of the trees

They look at each other for a second and then turn away.

DIANE & NICK
~Stop the world please

ALL
~Saturday.

CLAUDE
September 15th. Finally, they get the planes going again —and I go down to tell the Wish Kids that they’re being sent home without getting to Disneyworld after all. But they’re not sad about it. They’re going on hayrides, canoe rides, and someone dresses up as the town mascot: Commander Gander. And it turns out that if they’d made it to Orlando, they would've got four days of rain.

# Song 12a: Goodbyes

BONNIE is alone in the hangar with the animals.

BONNIE
(to DOUG)
I'm just doing one more litter scoop, and then I'll get them on the planes!

SHE bends down to a carrier.
Lyle. You're a beautiful cat. I’ve taped your pill bottle to your carrier and made sure someone’ll see it. You did good. You’re going to be fine.

SHE moves along.
Ralph. You’re a good cocker spaniel. I know the night security crew ran you a bit ragged, so I want you to sleep on the plane, okay?

RALPH barks.

BONNIE
Okay.

SHE moves again.
... Unga... I’ve never met a rare Bonobo chimpanzee before. We don’t get many of them here in Newfoundland. And since your partner there likes to throw his own feces, I’m going to say that you are the nicest rare Bonobo chimpanzee I’ve ever met... And I want you to know that I’m sorry... I’m sorry that you lost your baby... I’ve got three, and some days they’re more trouble than they’re worth... Anyway. You're going to be okay.

# Song 12b: The Wind Picks Up

BEVERLEY
The winds start to pick up. 50 mile an hour winds. We’ve been here too long. We’re still on the ground and there’s a hurricane coming. And I’m thinking — we're running out of time. We have to leave. We have to leave now.

KEVIN J
~Looking out the window

KEVIN T
Kevin, talk to me, please.

HANNAH
~And out the window we see

~A place we all know below

BEVERLEY hands BOB the microphone.

BOB
~Is this on? Oh, it’s on. Sorry, everyone — hi!
~Like most everyone, I am sorry saying goodbye
~So I wanted to thank them for all that they did
~So I’m doing just that —- and I’m passing a hat
~For the people who gave up their time
~And they gave up their town
~So let's give them a scholarship!
~Pass the hat down, cause

BOB holds up his Sou’wester hat and passes it along.

ALL
~Somewhere—in the middle of nowhere
~In the middle of who knows where (who knows where)
~There you’ll find (something in the middle of)
~Something — in the middle of nowhere
~In the middle of clear, blue air~ you found your heart but
~Left a part of you behind

DIANE
Nick and I sit together and I just want to say something, but we’re leaving... and it’s over...

NICK
And then she starts crying. And I don’t know what to say, so I just put my arm around her—and I go to kiss her on the forehead — to comfort her.

DIANE
Well, there was some turbulence — and honestly: I just thought he missed! So I—

SHE grabs NICK and kisses him.

BEVERLEY
~Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your window

At one point, a flight attendant comes ‘round saying...

# Song 14: Something's Missing

JANICE
~Back to the way that things were

OZ
~Back to the simple and plain

DWIGHT
~For five days the weather had been so nice

BONNIE
~But as they boarded it started to rain

A moment, as they ALL look up.

BEULAH
~At the end of the day, after everyone left

OZ
~We all tried to go back to normal except

CLAUDE
~The town was more quiet and somehow far emptier

BONNIE
~We all looked the same, but we're different than we were

BEULAH
~The gym was a sight—as I stacked the last cot

DWIGHT
~Thank-you's written everywhere and things they forgot

CLAUDE
~The Board of Health says clean it up—every part

ALL
~So we start

CLAUDE
7:42 am.

ALL
Sunday.

CLAUDE
September 16th. After five days, they just ran the zamboni over the ice. And played hockey.

With the Plane People gone, I tell my staff "Go home, get some sleep." We were all exhausted—just spent—most of us had been up for five days straight working. But somehow I can't sleep, so I sit down and turn on the television. And I just start crying. I hadn't let myself cry the whole time.

ALL
~Something's gone

BOB
Out the airplane window, I can see Manhattan and there's still smoke. And suddenly I'm afraid all over again—and there are others afraid too.

ALL
~Something's over

BOB
I know Newark airport. You could pull a truck over on the side of the turnpike and shoot a grenade launcher at a plane coming in.

ALL
~Something's done

BOB
But nothing happens.

KEVIN T
I drive Kevin back to his place. We don't say much.

ALL
~Something's missing

HANNAH
I go straight to his firehouse. Part of me wondered if they just weren't telling me, but... they still don't know.

ALL
~Something's changed

NICK
My flat is the same as I left it. But emptier. Quieter. I start to unpack—and I find the camera.

ALL
~Something's rearranged

ALI
On the way to my restaurant, I drop my daughter at school, but she won't go in. She says she's scared. What do I tell her?

ALL
~Something's strained

BOB
Back at my dad's house—I look out the window—at this view I've looked at my whole life. And now a part of it—something's missing.

ALL
~Something's missing

KEVIN T
Kevin breaks up with me. And then he quits and moves back home to New York. And I miss him. I miss his jokes.

ALL
~Something's lost

DIANE
Nick and I call each other when we can. But... it's awful. The only reason we met was because this terrible thing happened.

ALL
~Some things cost

BOB
I go down to Ground Zero, which is like the end of the world. It's literally still burning.

ALL
~Something's not

BOB
My dad asks, "Were you ok out where you were stranded?" How do I tell him that I wasn't just okay—I was so much better.

ALL
~Something's missing

BEVERLEY
I phone American and say, "I'm ready to go wherever you want to send me." But they say take a few days off. I phone every day and I am back at the airport by Thursday. And it's empty. Silent. It's just—a different place. And I stop what few passengers there are and I say, "Thank you for still flying."

BEULAH answers the phone.

BEULAH
Hello. You've reached the Gander Academy, this is Beulah Davis. How can I help

HANNAH
...He's gone. It's over.

BEULAH
...Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Hannah. I'm so sorry.

HANNAH
~You are here
~At the end of a moment
~At the end of the world
~You are here
~On the edge of the ocean
~Where the story ends
~Here

BEULAH
~Where the river meets the sea

EVERYONE ELSE
~Something's gone
~Something's over

NICK
~Across the Atlantic

KEVIN T
~At the office

BEVERLEY
~In an airport

DIANE
~In my house

BOB
~On an island

BEULAH
~In a classroom

EVERYONE ELSE
~Something's rearranged

JANICE
~At the station

OZ
~In my car

ALL
~And wherever you are (something's gone)
~You are here

# Song 15: Epilogue

CLAUDE
When the bank finally converted all the currency from around the world—people had donated over sixty thousand dollars.

EVERYONE whistles.

ANNETTE
Every day for months, passengers sent back chocolates, flowers...

BEULAH
Donations of all kinds.

CLAUDE
Postcards and letters came in from everywhere.

BEULAH opens a letter as ALI reads.

ALI
Dear Miss Beulah. When my daughter asks about what happened to me over those five days, I tell her about your kindness. Thank you again. Sincerely, Ali. PS., please send me the recipe for the fish and the cheese.

BONNIE and DOUG step forward.

BONNIE
Ralph, the cocker spaniel, went on to become a champion show dog!

DOUG
And Unga the rare Bonobo chimpanzee arrived safely at the Columbus Zoo.

BONNIE
And soon after, she had a baby—which they named Gander.

JANICE steps forward.

JANICE
Tom Brokaw phones me. Tom Brokaw. He's doing a documentary—and since I was the only reporter in town—I'm the only one with any footage. Tom. Brokaw.

It was a big break—but I didn't really like shoving microphones into people's faces when they were going through so much. So, I stayed here in Gander—and I'm still here today—on the tenth anniversary.

A REPORTER is interviewing BEVERLEY.

BEVERLEY
With all the new security, kids aren't even allowed up in the cockpit anymore. Of course on my retirement flight, I brought my whole family up to the cockpit, on our way back to Gander.

BOB
I came back with the scholarship money we raised—now worth over a million dollars.

DERM
I bring out the Irish whiskey and we have ourselves a toast.

A REPORTER is interviewing DIANE.

DIANE
Nick and I just couldn't make the long distance relationship work.

NICK joins the interview.

NICK
So, I moved to Texas—and then I proposed!

DIANE
And we honeymooned in Newfoundland.

A REPORTER is interviewing KEVIN T.

KEVIN T
My new secretary's name is Robin.

ROBIN (ACTOR 10)
What's up?

KEVIN T
Every year on September 11th, I close my office and give each employee 100 dollars to go and do random good deeds for strangers. It's my way of remembering what happened.

A REPORTER is interviewing HANNAH and BEULAH.

HANNAH
Beulah and I still keep in touch. She even came to visit me in New York—and I phone her if I hear a really stupid joke. Hey, Beulah. Why are Newfoundlanders terrible at knock knock jokes?

BEULAH
I don't know, Hannah.

HANNAH
Well, try it. I'll be a Newfoundlander.

BEULAH
Knock knock.

HANNAH
Come on in—the door's open!

BEULAH laughs. JANICE is interviewing OZ.

JANICE
The donation we are most honored by just arrived today.

OZ
It's about four meters long and 12,000 kilograms.

JANICE
Newfoundland is the only place outside of the United States, where we share the steel from the World Trade Center.

CLAUDE steps forward

CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there's an airport—and next to it, is a town called Gander.

Tonight, we honor what was lost. But we also commemorate what we found!

ALL
~You are here
~At the start of a moment
~On the edge of the world
~Where the river meets the sea
