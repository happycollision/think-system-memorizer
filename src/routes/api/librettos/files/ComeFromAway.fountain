.Scene 1

# Song 1 - Welcome To The Rock

A bodhran beats a fast rhythm.

CLAUDE  
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there's an airport—it used to be one of the biggest airports in the world. And next to it, is a town called Gander.

OZ  
There’s a two-person police department.

BEULAH  
An elementary school.

BONNIE  
An SPCA.

JANICE  
A local TV station.

DOUG  
And a hockey rink.

CLAUDE  
It’s a small place—on a giant rock in the ocean. Everybody knows everybody else. And everybody in this room has a story about how they started that day.

CLAUDE, OZ, BEULAH, BONNIE  
~ Welcome to the rock! If you come from away  
~ You'll probably understand about a half of what we say  
~ They say no man’s an island, but an island makes a man  
~ Especially when one comes from one like Newfoundland

ALL  
~ Welcome to the rock

BEULAH  
That morning, I’m in the classroom. It’s our first day back and the school buses are on strike, so I’m covering for Annette, who’s running late!

ANNETTE  
Sorry, Beulah! How’s the kids?

BEULAH  
Not exactly thrilled to be inside on such a gorgeous day, so I told them we'd only have a half-day this morning—and they were quite pleased—until I told them we’d have the other half in the afternoon.

SINGER 8  
~ Welcome to the wildest weather that you’ve ever heard of

SINGER 12  
~ Where everyone is nicer, but it’s never nice above

SINGER 6  
~ Welcome to the farthest place you'll get from Disneyland

SINGER 11  
~ Fish and chips and shipwrecks

WOMEN & SINGER 11  
~ This is Newfoundland

MEN  
~ Welcome to the rock

WOMEN  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander

ALL  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander

OZ  
That morning I’m in my car. The kids cross Airport Boulevard to get to school — and that time of day people are in a bit of a rush to get to work and stuff, so normally I sit there and run my radar.

(The cast makes a “WOOP-WOOP” noise together.)

OZ  
And if they're speeding, I'll stop ‘em and write out a warning ticket. I'll write “STFD” — Slow The Fuck Down.

ACTOR 2  
~ Welcome to the land where the winters tried to kill us

ALL  
~ We will not be killed

ACTOR 9  
~ Welcome to the land where the waters tried to drown us

ALL  
~ We will not be drowned

ACTOR 3  
~ Welcome to the land where we lost our loved ones

ALL  
~ We will still go on

ACTOR 10  
~ Welcome to the land where the winds tried to blow

ALL  
~ And we said no

BONNIE  
That morning, I drop my kids off at school and head to the SPCA, where I’m greeted by my other kids—all barking and meowing for breakfast and a belly rub. Not that I'm complaining. I loves ‘em. But by the time feeding’s done, I’ve got to get back to pick up my human kids. So, I take just one second for myself. And I’m sitting in my car.

BEULAH  
I’m in the staffroom.

ANNETTE  
I'm in the library.

BONNIE, BEULAH & ANNETTE  
And I turn on the radio.

ALL  
~ You are here  
~ At the start of a moment  
~ On the edge of the world  
~ Where the river meets the sea  
~ Here—on the edge of the Atlantic  
~ On an island in between  
~ There and here

ALL (hushed, repeating)  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander  
~ I'm an Islander, I am an Islander...

OZ  
I’m running my radar when Bonnie comes by. She pulls up, and she’s wavin’ at me like mad, so I roll down my window and she says...

BONNIE  
Oz, turn on the radio!

OZ  
Slow it down, Bonnie.

BONNIE  
Jesus H.! Oz! Turn on your radio!

COMPANY  
~ Where our stories start

JANICE  
It’s my first day at the station.

COMPANY  
~ Where we'll end the night

GARTH  
I’m getting coffee for the picket line.

COMPANY  
~ Where we know by heart

CRYSTAL  
Five minutes ‘til my smoke break.

COMPANY  
~ Every single flight

DWIGHT  
I'm off to work at the airport.

MEN  
~ Welcome to the fog  
~ Welcome to the trees  
~ To the ocean—and the sky  
~ And whatever’s in between  
~ To the ones who’ve left

MEN  
~ You're never truly gone  
~ A candle’s in the window  
~ And the kettle’s always on

ALL  
~ When the sun is coming up  
~ And the world has come ashore  
~ If you’re hoping for a harbour  
~ Then you'll find an open door  
~ In the winter from the water  
~ Through whatever's in the way  
~ To the ones who have come from away  
~ Welcome to the rock!


.Scene 2

CLAUDE  
I starts my day at Tim ‘Ortons. Don’t drink coffee. Don’t drink tea. An’ I’ve no use for donuts. But I'll grab a Pepsi and get a lay o’ the land. As the Mayor, it’s ‘ow I keep in touch with the people an’ such. Everything starts and ends at Tim ‘Ortons.

CLAUDE enters Tim Hortons.

CLAUDE  
Morning, Garth.

GARTH  
Morning, Claude.

CLAUDE  
Morning, Crystal.

CRYSTAL  
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

CLAUDE  
Dwight.

DWIGHT  
Morning Claude. Garth. Crystal.

DOUG  
Claude. Crystal. Dwight. Garth. Morning.

CRYSTAL  
Morning, b’ys. Pepsi?

CLAUDE  
That's right, Crystal. What's the news?

DWIGHT  
School bus strike still on?

CLAUDE  
Ahya. We’re working it out.

GARTH  
Well, we’re coming to the table.

CLAUDE  
Well, we’re coming to the table too.

DWIGHT  
Are they tearing down the airport?

CLAUDE  
Not today.
