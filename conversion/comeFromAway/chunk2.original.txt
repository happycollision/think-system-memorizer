COME FROM AWAY
Scene 1
#1-~—Welcome To The Rock
A bodhran beats a fast rhythm.
CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there’s an
airport—it used to be one of the biggest airports in the world. And next to it, is a
town called Gander.
OZ
- There’s a two-person police department.

BONNIE

, DOUG
And a hockey rink.
- CLAUDE
-_ It’s a small place—on a giant rock in the ocean. Everybody knows everybody else.
And everybody in this room has a story about how they started that day.
WELCOME TO THE ROCK! IF YOU COME FROM AWAY
YOU'LL PROBABLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT A HALF OF WHAT WE SAY

BEULAH
That morning, I’m in the classroom. It’s our first day back and the school busses are
on strike, so I’m covering for Annette, who’s running late!
ANNETTE
Sorry, Beulah! How’s the kids?
COME FROM AWAY
BEULAH
Not exactly thrilled to be inside on such a gorgeous day, so I told them we'd only
have a half-day this morning — and they were quite pleased — until I told them we’d
have the other half in the afternoon.

OZ
That morning I’m in my car. The kids cross Airport Boulevard to get to school —and
that time a day people are in a little bit of a rush to get to work and stuff, so
normally I sit there and run my radar.
OZ cues the cast to make a “WOOP-WOOP” noise together.
And if they're speeding, I'll stop ‘em and write out a warning ticket. I'll write

BONNIE
That morning, I drop my kids off at school and head to the SPCA, where I’m greeted
by my other kids ~—all barking and meowing for breakfast and a belly rub. Not that
I'm complaining. I loves ‘em. But by the time feeding’s done, I’ve got to get back to
pick up my human kids. So, I take just one second for myself. And I’m sitting in my
car.
BEULAH
I’m in the staffroom.
ANNETTE
I'm in the library.
BONNIE, BEULAH & ANNETTE
And I turn on the radio.

I’m running my radar when Bonnie comes by. She pulls up, and she’s wavin’ at me
like mad, so I roll down my window and she says...
BONNIE
Oz, turn on the radio!
OZ
Slow it down, Bonnie.
BONNIE

CLAUDE
I starts my day at Tim ‘Ortons. Don’t drink coffee. Don’t drink tea. An’ I’ve no use
for donuts. But I'll grab a Pepsi and get a lay o’ the land. As the Mayor, it’s ‘ow |

Excuse me, I’m looking for the Mayor.
EVERYONE points at CLAUDE.
JANICE
Mister Mayor —I’m Janice Mosher with Rogers TV. I’m new. To town—and new to
reporting. It’s my first day.
CLAUDE
Where you longs to, Janice?
JANICE
Port Aux Basque. So if you see me running red lights or anything, just forgive me
because we don’t have stop lights over there.
CLAUDE
Well welcome to Gander, Janice.
DWIGHT

GARTH

CLAUDE
If you’re looking for news, you should talk to that man running in here. That's our
constable, Oz Fudge. He’s full of stories.
COME FROM AWAY
OZ runs in.
OZ
Mister Mayor, I saw your car in the lot. Crystal, turn up the radio so’s we all can
hear. Doug, you probably want to get down to Air Traffic Control right away.
DOUG
There’s only supposed to be two air traffic controllers on, but instead there’s
fourteen... Everyone’s heard and they all shows up without even being asked. We're
told there'll be over 200 planes getting diverted across the country.

The flight attendant button goes “BOONG-BOONG. .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)
Ladies and Gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Looks like we'll be making an
unexpected landing in Gander, New Found Land.
The PASSENGERS start murmuring restlessly. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns to
the audience, and the PASSENGERS freeze. .
Anybody in the business knows when you set down in Gander, it's for an
emergency. Now, we don’t know what's going on, but the Captain tells us to keep
everyone from panicking.
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns back, as the PASSENGERS unfreeze.
Tray tables up, please. We will be dimming the lights in the cabin. Pushing the
light-bulb button will turn your reading light on; however, pushing the
flight-attendant button will not turn your flight attendant on.
