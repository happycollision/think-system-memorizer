Scene 30
OZ
By eight o’clock the bar is completely packed with people from around the world.
Everybody’s talking about where they’re staying and what they've seen—and the
bar staff keep making runs for more beer and liquor. After an hour, people are
swimming in the river out back. And no, no one brought their swim trunks!
A couple of the local b’ys get up with their accordions and fiddles—and someone
brings out an ugly stick.
A brief ugly stick solo & fiddle solo.

NICK DIANE
Ah— Well, why not?!
NICK
Diane had had two beers by then, so it was probably the alcohol talking.
DIANE
I’ve never had more than one beer at a time before, so it was probably the alcohol
talking.
NICK

(holding a bottle)
Ladies and Gentlemen. This is Screech. Back in World War 2, an officer was stationed
here and was offered some of this stuff. All the locals were tossing it back with nar’ a
quiver, so he does too, and lets out an ear-piecing...
CLAUDE and all the LOCALS howl.
Everybody comes to see what's happened and says —
ALL Except SCREECHEES
“What was that ungodly screech?!”

BOB
And then they brought the Cod.
KEVIN T

NICK

DIANE
Oh, God. I can’t do it.
NICK

CLAUDE
Now you gotta kiss the cod—it’s a vital part of the ceremony.
DIANE
No! I can’t do it!
CLAUDE

Scene 31
BEVERLEY sits alone in her hotel room, wide-awake.
#11—Me and the Sky
BEVERLEY
MY PARENTS MUST HAVE THOUGHT
THEY HAD A CRAZY KID
CAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS
WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHAT I WANTED
THEY TOOK ME DOWN TO THE AIRPORT
TO SEE ALL THE PLANES DEPARTING
WATCHING THEM FLY SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME WAS STARTING
I WAS EIGHT WHEN I TOLD THEM
THAT I'D BE A PILOT
BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG AND TOO SHORT
AND THERE WERE NO FEMALE CAPTAINS
AND MY DAD SAID BE PATIENT
HE SAID JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS
BUT I TOOK MY FIRST LESSON
CAME DOWN FROM THE SKY AND
TOLD MY FATHER I'D FLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
AND I GOT MY FIRST JOB
FLYING FOR A MORTICIAN
IN A TINY BONANZA
JUST A CORPSE AND ME
FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR
FOR FLYING DEAD BODIES
I HAD TO CLIMB OVER THEIR FACES
JUST TO GET TO MY SEAT
AND SUDDENLY THE WHEELS LIFT OFF
THE GROUND IS FALLING BACKWARDS
I AM SUDDENLY ALIVE
[[Page 92]]
(BEVERLEY)
SUDDENLY I’M IN THE COCKPIT
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING’S CHANGED
SUDDENLY I'M NOT TOO YOUNG OR TOO SHORT
AND THE PASSENGERS IN THE BACK DON’T COMPLAIN
SUDDENLY I’M FLYING COMPANY CHARTERS
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING'S HIGH
SUDDENLY THERE’S NOTHING IN BETWEEN
ME AND THE SKY
AMERICAN AIRLINES
HAD THE PRETTIEST PLANES
SO I APPLIED AS A FLIGHT ENGINEER
BUT THE WORLD WAR 2 PILOTS, THEY ALL COMPLAINED
THEY SAID, “GIRLS SHOULDN'T BE IN THE COCKPIT ~ HEY LADY, HEY BABY,
HEY, WHY DON’T YOU GRAB US A DRINK?”
AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WEREN'T MY FRIENDS BACK THEN
AND THEY SAID, “ARE YOU BETTER THAN US, DO YOU THINK?”
BUT I KEPT GETTING HIRED AND
THE WORLD WAR 2 CREW - THEY RETIRED AND
THE GIRLS ALL THOUGHT MUCH HIGHER OF ME
The women become FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, clapping, singing backup.
1986 - THE FIRST FEMALE AMERICAN CAPTAIN IN HISTORY
SUDDENLY I’M IN THE COCKPIT
SUDDENLY I'VE GOT MY WINGS
SUDDENLY ALL OF THOSE PILOTS PROTESTING ME
WELL THEY CAN GET THEIR OWN DRINKS!
SUDDENLY THERE’S NO ONE SAYING STAY GROUNDED
LOOKING DOWN - PASSING THEM BY
SUDDENLY THERE’S NOTHING IN BETWEEN
ME AND THE SKY
SUDDENLY I’ VE GOT AN ALL FEMALE CREW
THE NEWS CAUGHT AND MADE HEADLINES ACROSS THE WORLD
SUDDENLY IT STOPPED, NO-ONE’S SAYING
BEVERLEY (With FLIGHT ATTENDANTS)
(YOU CAN’T) OR (YOU WON'T)
OR YOU KNOW YOU’RE NOT ANYTHING (CAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL)
[[Page 93]]
BEVERLEY
SUDDENLY I'M GETTING MARRIED
AND WE'RE PUTTING PINS ON A MAP WHERE WE'VE FLOWN
SUDDENLY I AM A MOTHER
AND SUDDENLY SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH THEY’ VE GROWN
SUDDENLY I’M WOND’RING HOW MY PARENTS WOULD FEEL
SEEING ME TEACHING MEN TO BE PILOTS
CAUSE SUDDENLY I AM A SENIOR INSTRUCTOR
AND SOMEHOW I’M FIFTY-ONE
SUDDENLY I'M FLYING PARIS TO DALLAS,
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, AND FEELING CALM
WHEN SUDDENLY SOMEONE ON AIR-TO-AIR TRAFFIC SAYS,
AT 8:46 THERE’S BEEN A TERRORIST ACTION
AND THE ONE THING I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING
WAS USED AS THE BOMB
SUDDENLY I'M IN A HOTEL
SUDDENLY SOMETHING HAS DIED
SUDDENLY THERE'S SOMETHING IN BETWEEN
ME AND THE...
BEVERLEY answers the phone.
Hello?
I’m on my way.

#11a— Departures
JANICE
1:34am
ALL
Friday.
JANICE
September 14th. Shelters will be alerted as each plane is cleared to go.
BOB
Our pilot says to pack up. It’s sudden notice —the middle of the night—and we're
leaving in an hour. But these people — they make these bag lunches—and they form
a... a gauntlet — handing them out—and we all walk through it and get our lunches
and say goodbye to all of them. We try to give them money, but they won't take it.
DERM
No, m’son. You would’ve done the same.
BOB
I drank all your whiskey.
| DERM
I would’ve done the same.
BOB and DERM hug.
