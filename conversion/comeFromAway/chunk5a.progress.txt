.Scene 30

OZ
By eight o’clock the bar is completely packed with people from around the world. Everybody’s talking about where they’re staying and what they've seen—and the bar staff keep making runs for more beer and liquor. After an hour, people are swimming in the river out back. And no, no one brought their swim trunks!
A couple of the local b’ys get up with their accordions and fiddles—and someone brings out an ugly stick.

A brief ugly stick solo & fiddle solo.

MEN
~Farewell to all you pretty ladies
~Waving from the dock
~Heave away, me jollies, heave away
~And if we do return to you
~We'll make your cradles rock
~Heave away, me jolly boys, we're all bound away

WOMEN
~Farewell you Newfoundlander boys
~You're leaving us alone
~Heave away, me jollies, heave away
~And if you find another
~We've got lovers of our own

ALL
~Heave away, me jolly boys, we're all bound away

OZ
And then we get the karaoke going.

DELORES
~Near... far...

ALL
~Wherever we are!

EVERYONE cheers.

OZ
Then we decide to have a bit of a ceremony.

CLAUDE
Let’s make these people honorary Newfoundlanders!

# Song 10: Screech In

(CLAUDE)
~Now there's a solemn, old tradition
~For admission — or audition —to transition
~From a come from away

ALL
~To be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~The only other way at any rate
~Is pass away and pray to fate and wait
~To reincarnate

ALL
~As a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey - come on inside
~Nothing ventured nothing tried

ACTOR 5
~Only a couple people cried

ALL
~You'll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey —sit down right here
~You'll feel better in a year

ACTOR 7
~Try to ignore your doubts and fears

ALL
~And you'll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
Now we needs a couple volunteers! Who wants to become a Newfoundlander?
Right here!

CLAUDE
Good man! Who else?

KEVIN T
I have no idea why I put up my hand. Kevin’s like...

KEVIN J
Oh my god are you serious?

KEVIN T tries to dance a jig.
Oh my god — you are serious.

KEVIN T
Yes—I’m serious. Don’t do it if you don’t want to.

KEVIN J
I won't.

CLAUDE
Where you from, Buddy?

KEVIN T
Los Angeles.

CLAUDE
LA! Who else?

DIANE
Us!

NICK DIANE
Actually, I’m not sure I don’t like performing... We want to be Newfoundlanders!

CLAUDE
Alright, then. Where are you folks from?

DIANE
Texas and —

CLAUDE
Texas!
(to NICK)
What part of Texas are you from, buddy?

NICK DIANE
No. I’m from — No! I’M from Texas. He’s from (like the Queen) "England."
Well, wait. Now how does that work?

CLAUDE
NICK
How does what work?

CLAUDE
How does your marriage work with you being in England and her in Texas?

NICK DIANE
No— No—we're not married.

CLAUDE
Oh, I’m sorry - I just assumed you were married... Well, would you like to be?

NICK DIANE
Ah— Well, why not?!

NICK
Diane had had two beers by then, so it was probably the alcohol talking.

DIANE
I’ve never had more than one beer at a time before, so it was probably the alcohol talking.

NICK
I went and got her two more beers.

CLAUDE
~Now the first part is the easiest
~We'll soon get to the queasiest
~I'll need you to repeat this mess

ALL
~When you become a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~'Cause we speaks a different language, son
~We adds some esses and some rum
~You'll have to try a good cod tongue

ALL
~When you become a Newfoundlander

CHORUS
~Hey hey —just do your best
~Nothing scary - nothing yet

ACTOR 3
~You'll have to change the way you’re dressed

THEY put Sou’wester hats on each screechee.

ALL
~And you’ll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey - just sing along
~Nothing ventured just prolonged

CLAUDE
~There's thirty verses in this song

ALL
~Then you'll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
(holding a bottle)
Ladies and Gentlemen. This is Screech. Back in World War 2, an officer was stationed here and was offered some of this stuff. All the locals were tossing it back with nar’ a quiver, so he does too, and lets out an ear-piecing...

CLAUDE and all the LOCALS howl.

Everybody comes to see what's happened and says —

ALL Except SCREECHEES
“What was that ungodly screech?!”

CLAUDE
And now it’s your turn. Are you ready?

NICK DIANE BOB KEVIN T
Um... I’m not sure that — Wait — did you just say — No. Nope. Not really ready. Do we have to drink this?

CLAUDE
Good! All together now. One!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
ONE!

CLAUDE
Two!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
TWO!

CLAUDE
Three!

ALL Except SCREECHEES
THREE!

CLAUDE
Down the hatch!

EVERYONE cheers as THEY drink. BOB howls. NICK grimaces. KEVIN T shakes his head. DIANE taps her glass, getting every drop out.

KEVIN T
Screech is basically bad Jamaican rum.

NICK
Screech is horrific.

DIANE
Screech is delishush!

BOB
And then they brought the Cod.

KEVIN T
The Cod.

NICK
The Cod.

DIANE
The Cod.

A codfish is brought out and handed to CLAUDE.

CLAUDE
~Now with every transformation
~Comes a tiny bit of risk
~You've got to walk the plank
~And there’ll be blood or there’ll be bliss
~And it’s the same to be a Newfoundlander
~Every person's wish
~So don’t be dumb
~Just take the plunge
~And go on— kiss the fish!

NEWFOUNDLANDERS
(continued underneath, building steadily)
~I'm an islander—I am an islander
~I'm an islander—I am an islander...

CLAUDE
Ladies and gentlemen —this is a genuine freshly caught Newfoundland Cod —and if you want to become an honorary Newfoundlander, you'll have to give her a smooch!
One!

BOB kisses the fish and cheers.

KEVIN J
If you kiss that, I will never kiss you again!

KEVIN T
I'll risk it!
Two!

KEVIN T kisses the fish.

CLAUDE
NICK
I'm not kissing a fish!
Come on, I will if you will!

DIANE
NICK
Oh, my god. Fine.

NICK kisses the fish and grimaces.

DIANE
Oh, God. I can’t do it.

NICK
What? I just did!

CLAUDE
Now you gotta kiss the cod—it’s a vital part of the ceremony.

DIANE
No! I can’t do it!

CLAUDE
Alright —look here. I'll make you a deal. Either you kiss this fish —or else you kiss this Englishman that you're not married to.

NICK
Wait.... what?

DIANE
Okay.

DIANE kisses him.

ALL
~Hey hey —come on tonight
~Take a risk and take a ride
~Jump right in with both feet tied
~And you'll be a Newfoundlander
~Hey hey —come on once more
~Nothing ventured, nothing sore
~After it’s over, out the door
~And you’ll be a Newfoundlander

CLAUDE
~After it’s over you’ll remember

ALL
~That you’re a Newfoundlander

# Song 10a: After Screech

The band kicks in again, as EVERYONE trails out of the bar.

CLAUDE
Good job L.A.!

OZ
Goodnight now!

KEVIN T
Kevin? Where'd you go? Kevin?

.Scene 31

BEVERLEY sits alone in her hotel room, wide-awake.

# Song 11: Me and the Sky

BEVERLEY
~My parents must have thought
~They had a crazy kid
~Cause I was one of those kids
~Who always knew what I wanted
~They took me down to the airport
~To see all the planes departing
~Watching them fly something inside of me was starting
~I was eight when I told them
~That I'd be a pilot
~But I was too young and too short
~And there were no female captains
~And my dad said be patient
~He said just see what happens
~But I took my first lesson
~Came down from the sky and
~Told my father I'd fly for the rest of my life
~And I got my first job
~Flying for a mortician
~In a tiny Bonanza
~Just a corpse and me
~Five dollars an hour
~For flying dead bodies
~I had to climb over their faces
~Just to get to my seat
~And suddenly the wheels lift off
~The ground is falling backwards
~I am suddenly alive

(BEVERLEY)
~Suddenly I’m in the cockpit
~Suddenly everything’s changed
~Suddenly I'm not too young or too short
~And the passengers in the back don’t complain
~Suddenly I’m flying company charters
~Suddenly everything's high
~Suddenly there’s nothing in between
~Me and the sky
~American Airlines
~Had the prettiest planes
~So I applied as a flight engineer
~But the World War 2 pilots, they all complained
~They said, “Girls shouldn't be in the cockpit ~ hey lady, hey baby,
~Hey, why don’t you grab us a drink?”
~And the flight attendants weren't my friends back then
~And they said, “Are you better than us, do you think?”
~But I kept getting hired and
~The World War 2 crew - they retired and
~The girls all thought much higher of me

The women become FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, clapping, singing backup.

~1986 - the first female American captain in history
~Suddenly I’m in the cockpit
~Suddenly I've got my wings
~Suddenly all of those pilots protesting me
~Well they can get their own drinks!
~Suddenly there’s no one saying stay grounded
~Looking down - passing them by
~Suddenly there’s nothing in between
~Me and the sky
~Suddenly I’ve got an all female crew
~The news caught and made headlines across the world
~Suddenly it stopped, no-one’s saying

BEVERLEY (With FLIGHT ATTENDANTS)
~(You can’t) or (you won't)
~Or you know you’re not anything (cause you’re a girl)

BEVERLEY
~Suddenly I'm getting married
~And we're putting pins on a map where we've flown
~Suddenly I am a mother
~And suddenly shocked at how much they’ve grown
~Suddenly I’m wond’ring how my parents would feel
~Seeing me teaching men to be pilots
~Cause suddenly I am a senior instructor
~And somehow I’m fifty-one
~Suddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas,
~Across the Atlantic, and feeling calm
~When suddenly someone on air-to-air traffic says,
~At 8:46 there’s been a terrorist action
~And the one thing I loved more than anything
~Was used as the bomb
~Suddenly I'm in a hotel
~Suddenly something has died
~Suddenly there's something in between
~Me and the...

BEVERLEY answers the phone.

Hello?
I’m on my way.

# Song 11a: Departures

JANICE
1:34am

ALL
Friday.

JANICE
September 14th. Shelters will be alerted as each plane is cleared to go.

BOB
Our pilot says to pack up. It’s sudden notice —the middle of the night—and we're leaving in an hour. But these people — they make these bag lunches—and they form a... a gauntlet — handing them out—and we all walk through it and get our lunches and say goodbye to all of them. We try to give them money, but they won't take it.

DERM
No, m’son. You would’ve done the same.

BOB
I drank all your whiskey.

DERM
I would’ve done the same.

BOB and DERM hug.
