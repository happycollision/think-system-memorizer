Everyone become PASSENGERS, facing sideways. One of the passengers, DIANE,
turns out the window.
DIANE
I look out the window to see if there’s something mechanical —like if we've lost an
engine or if something’s on fire. But I don’t see anything.
Another passenger, NICK, turns out his window.
NICK
I told head office I need to travel less —I told them it was doctor’s orders. But they
say, “You're going to the conference,” so you go.
BOB turns out his window.
BOB
My dad is always saying, Bob, you've got to calm down. But the flight attendant is
shaking like a leaf, so I figure I’ve got permission.
HANNAH turns out her window.
HANNAH
My son sends me on this vacation—he says, “Mom, you've never gone anywhere.”
And whenI get back, I’m telling him — this is exactly why.
KEVINT turns out his window.
KEVIN T
Suddenly, there's a drop.
The GROUP drops, with a gasp.
A sudden change in direction. AndI fly a lot, so I know that's not normal. Outside
the window, all I can see below are trees and rocks and... nothing.

At the Academy, BEULAH and ANNETTE address everyone.

the cafeteria? And if anyone speaks Newfoundlander, well lard tunder’n jaysus god

ANNETTE
We've got passengers from all over the world coming off these busses, all speaking
different languages. We can’t even say “hello.”

Spanish.

HE exits with a flourish.
