AUTHOR’S NOTES
The set is primarily made up of 12 different chairs. For each scene, the cast
reconfigures them into different arrangements. Costume pieces and props are also
minimal and used only as needed. All sound effects are made by the cast.
TIME & PLACE
September 2001 through 2011.
Central Newfoundland, 38 Airplanes, New York, Texas, California, England and
other locations.
SYNOPSIS
COME FROM AWAY tells the true story of when seven thousand people from
across America and around the world landed on the doorstep of Gander,
Newfoundland... and the people of Gander “put the kettle on.” When 38 planes
were diverted to a small, Canadian community on September 11th, 2001, the
town’s population doubled in an instant. While the world witnessed the worst acts
of humankind, the stranded passengers had their faith in humanity restored by the
spirited people who comforted those who had come from away.

COME FROM AWAY
Scene 1
#1-~—Welcome To The Rock
A bodhran beats a fast rhythm.
CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there’s an
airport—it used to be one of the biggest airports in the world. And next to it, is a
town called Gander.

-_ It’s a small place—on a giant rock in the ocean. Everybody knows everybody else.
And everybody in this room has a story about how they started that day.

Not exactly thrilled to be inside on such a gorgeous day, so I told them we'd only

That morning I’m in my car. The kids cross Airport Boulevard to get to school —and
that time a day people are in a little bit of a rush to get to work and stuff, so
normally I sit there and run my radar.
OZ cues the cast to make a “WOOP-WOOP” noise together.
And if they're speeding, I'll stop ‘em and write out a warning ticket. I'll write

I'm complaining. I loves ‘em. But by the time feeding’s done, I’ve got to get back to
pick up my human kids. So, I take just one second for myself. And I’m sitting in my

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)
Ladies and Gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Looks like we'll be making an
unexpected landing in Gander, New Found Land.
The PASSENGERS start murmuring restlessly. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns to
the audience, and the PASSENGERS freeze. .
Anybody in the business knows when you set down in Gander, it's for an
emergency. Now, we don’t know what's going on, but the Captain tells us to keep
everyone from panicking.
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns back, as the PASSENGERS unfreeze.
Tray tables up, please. We will be dimming the lights in the cabin. Pushing the
light-bulb button will turn your reading light on; however, pushing the

Everyone become PASSENGERS, facing sideways. One of the passengers, DIANE,
turns out the window.
DIANE
I look out the window to see if there’s something mechanical —like if we've lost an
engine or if something’s on fire. But I don’t see anything.
Another passenger, NICK, turns out his window.
NICK
I told head office I need to travel less —I told them it was doctor’s orders. But they
say, “You're going to the conference,” so you go.
BOB turns out his window.
BOB
My dad is always saying, Bob, you've got to calm down. But the flight attendant is
shaking like a leaf, so I figure I’ve got permission.
HANNAH turns out her window.
HANNAH
My son sends me on this vacation—he says, “Mom, you've never gone anywhere.”
And whenI get back, I’m telling him — this is exactly why.
KEVINT turns out his window.
KEVIN T
Suddenly, there's a drop.
The GROUP drops, with a gasp.
A sudden change in direction. AndI fly a lot, so I know that's not normal. Outside
the window, all I can see below are trees and rocks and... nothing.

No —I just needed to get an emergency prescription filled -my medication is in my

Okay. I’m allergic to bananas and I have never had the chicken pox.

Scene 26
#7f—I Am Here
BEULAH
Anyway I get lunch set up, labeling anything that'll go bad with the date and time, I
let the pants out for one of the pilots who’s been enjoying our cooking. I make a
balloon animal for a crying toddler —and then I check on Hannah, talking to anyone
she can reach.
On the other side of the stage, HANNAH puts the phone to her ear,
HANNAH
1 AM HERE—I AM HERE ON AN ISLAND
HELLO? HELLO. IT’S ME AGAIN
YEAH, MY SON. HE’S WITH RESCUE TWO
ANY NEWS?
1 AM HIS MOTHER
I’M FAR AWAY —STUCK HERE

AND SAYS, “I’M HOME, MOM”

BEULAH
She leaves message after message for her son— until there’s no more room on his
answering machine.
HANNAH
ALLI KNOW
IS YOU ARE THERE
YOU ARE THERE
AND 1 AM HERE
BEULAH
She finally got some news.
HANNAH
They said it was Kev’s day off —but someone else said there were more men down
there than were scheduled.
I should be looking for him. He’s always there for me—trying to make me laugh.
Tells me stupid jokes. He loves jokes —tells them to the kids at the firehouse, while
he fixes their bikes.
I should be there.
BEULAH
I know there’s nothing I can do to help. But I do know a few jokes. There was a
sailor who was stationed in the South Pacific, far away from his wife who he'd just
married. And when he was away, he wrote her a letter. He said, “We're going to be
apart for a long time —and this island is full of young, attractive native girls. I need
something to take my mind off them.”
So his wife sends him an accordion and says, “Why don’t you learn to play this
then?” So finally, he comes home from his tour of duty and says to his wife, “I can’t
wait to get you into bed.” And she says, “First let’s see how well you play that
accordion.”
SHE laughs at her own joke, but sees HANNAH 's face and stops.
COME FROM AWAY

HANNAH
That was a really stupid joke.
A pause.
Tell me another one.

Scene 27
KEVIN T
Everywhere you look, there are people from around the globe. Going back and forth
for phones — or showers. Grabbing something from Shoppers. I’m getting coffee at a
gas station on the main drag —and suddenly the entire place goes quiet...
#72 — Before Praye
EVERYONE on stage stands still. KEVIN turns around, looking.
And nobody moves. Even the people outside are standing still. And I look up at the
TVs and realize —it’s a national moment of silence in America. And all of these
Newfoundlanders— these people from another country — they maintain that moment
of silence. I don’t know if that would happen back home —at a busy gas station on
the main drag — but it happened here.
HANNAH
Beulah walks me to church—and when we get there, I light a candle for my son.
BEULAH
And I do too.
KEVIN T
I suddenly realized what that music was from my dream —it was an old hymn from
when I was a kid. Now, I haven’t been to church in years, but for some reason that
song was in my head.
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
“WHERE THERE IS HATRED, LET ME BRING YOUR LOVE,
WHERE THERE IS INJURY, YOUR PARDON, LORD,
AND WHERE THERE'S DOUBT TRUE FAITH IN YOU.
HANNAH KEVIN T

I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents — they were Jews — they sent me here
before the war started —I still remember some prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was
told I should never tell anyone that I was Jewish—even my wife. But after what
happened on Tuesday —so many stories gone —just like that. I needed to tell someone.
ALI (ACTOR 9)
During El-Fagir, when most people are asleep it is easier to pray. But at El-Dhuhr, I
can feel them watching me. Sometimes I catch them when they think I’m not looking
—and I can see the fear in their eyes.

looking for some peace —and a quiet place to pray.

I am responsible for the safety of my passengers and my crew. And security tells me

They bring me to a private room and he is brought in for questioning.
ALI
At first I do not understand what the police are asking. And then I do.
In my culture, there is a word— “awrah” —the area between your stomach and your
knees. It is forbidden in my religion for anyone to see this but my wife.
To have a woman in the room, watching this. Watching me. You can’t understand.
BEVERLEY
It is the most thorough body search I’ve ever witnessed. And when it’s over, I find
him and I tell him—I am so very sorry that happened.

September 15th. Finally, they get the planes going again —and I go down to tell the
Wish Kids that they’re being sent home without getting to Disneyworld after all. But
they’re not sad about it. They’re going on hayrides, canoe rides, and someone
dresses up as the town mascot: Commander Gander. And it turns out that if they’d
made it to Orlando, they would've got four days of rain.

someone’ll see it. You did good. You’re going to be fine.
SHE moves along.
Ralph. You’re a good cocker spaniel. I know the night security crew ran you a bit
ragged, so I want you to sleep on the plane, okay?
RALPH barks.
Okay.
SHE moves again.
... Unga... I’ve never met a rare Bonobo chimpanzee before. We don’t get many of
them here in Newfoundland. And since your partner there likes to throw his own
feces, I’m going to say that you are the nicest rare Bonobo chimpanzee I’ve ever
met... And I want you to know that I’m sorry... I’m sorry that you lost your baby...
