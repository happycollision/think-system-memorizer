COME FROM AWAY

.Scene 1

# Song 1: Welcome To The Rock

A bodhran beats a fast rhythm.

CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there's an airport—it used to be one of the biggest airports in the world. And next to it, is a town called Gander.

OZ
There's a two-person police department.

BEULAH
An elementary school.

BONNIE
An SPCA.

JANICE
A local TV station.

DOUG
And a hockey rink.

CLAUDE
It's a small place—on a giant rock in the ocean. Everybody knows everybody else. And everybody in this room has a story about how they started that day.

ALL
~Welcome to the rock! If you come from away
~You'll probably understand about a half of what we say
~They say no man's an island, but an island makes a man

CLAUDE, OZ, BEULAH, BONNIE
~'Specially when one comes from one like Newfoundland

ALL
~Welcome to the rock

BEULAH
That morning, I'm in the classroom. It's our first day back and the school busses are on strike, so I'm covering for Annette, who's running late!

ANNETTE
Sorry, Beulah! How's the kids?

BEULAH
Not exactly thrilled to be inside on such a gorgeous day, so I told them we'd only have a half-day this morning — and they were quite pleased — until I told them we'd have the other half in the afternoon.

SINGER 8
~Welcome to the wildest weather that you've ever heard of

SINGER 12
~Where everyone is nicer, but it's never nice above

SINGER 6
~Welcome to the farthest place you'll get from Disneyland

SINGER 11
~Fish and chips and shipwrecks

WOMEN & SINGER 11
~This is Newfoundland

MEN
~Welcome to the rock

WOMEN
~I'm an islander, I am an islander

ALL
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander

OZ
That morning I'm in my car. The kids cross Airport Boulevard to get to school —and that time a day people are in a little bit of a rush to get to work and stuff, so normally I sit there and run my radar.

OZ cues the cast to make a "WOOP-WOOP" noise together.

OZ (CONT'D)
And if they're speeding, I'll stop 'em and write out a warning ticket. I'll write "STFD" - Slow The Fuck Down.

ACTOR 2
~Welcome to the land where the winters tried to kill us
~And we said

ALL
~We will not be killed

ACTOR 9
~Welcome to the land where the waters tried to drown us
~And we said

ALL
~We will not be drowned

ACTOR 3
~Welcome to the land where we lost our loved ones
~And we said

ALL
~We will still go on

ACTOR 10
~Welcome to the land where the winds tried to blow

ALL
~And we said no

BONNIE
That morning, I drop my kids off at school and head to the SPCA, where I'm greeted by my other kids - all barking and meowing for breakfast and a belly rub. Not that I'm complaining. I loves 'em. But by the time feeding's done, I've got to get back to pick up my human kids. So, I take just one second for myself. And I'm sitting in my car.

BEULAH
I'm in the staffroom.

ANNETTE
I'm in the library.

BONNIE, BEULAH & ANNETTE
And I turn on the radio.

ALL
~You are here
~At the start of a moment
~On the edge of the world
~Where the river meets the sea
~Here—on the edge of the Atlantic
~On an island in between
~There and here

ALL
(repeated hushed underneath)
~I'm an islander, I am an islander
~I'm an islander, I am an islander...

OZ
I'm running my radar when Bonnie comes by. She pulls up, and she's wavin' at me like mad, so I roll down my window and she says...

BONNIE
Oz, turn on the radio!

OZ
Slow it down, Bonnie.

BONNIE
Jesus H.! Oz! Turn on your radio!

COMPANY
~Where our stories start

JANICE
It's my first day at the station.

COMPANY
~Where we'll end the night

GARTH
I'm getting coffee for the picket line.

COMPANY
~Where we know by heart

CRYSTAL
Five minutes 'til my smoke break.

COMPANY
~Every single flight

DWIGHT
I'm off to work at the airport.

MEN
~Welcome to the fog
~Welcome to the trees,
~To the ocean — and the sky
~And whatever's in between
~To the ones who've left

MEN (CONT'D)
~You're never truly gone
~A candle's in the window
~And the kettle's always on

ALL
~When the sun is coming up
~And the world has come ashore
~If you're hoping for a harbour
~Then you'll find an open door
~In the winter from the water
~Through whatever's in the way
~To the ones who have come from away
~Welcome to the rock!

.Scene 2

CLAUDE
I starts my day at Tim 'Ortons. Don't drink coffee. Don't drink tea. An' I've no use for donuts. But I'll grab a Pepsi and get a lay o' the land. As the Mayor, it's 'ow I keep in touch with the people an' such. Everything starts and ends at Tim 'Ortons.

CLAUDE enters Tim Hortons.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
Morning, Garth.

GARTH (ACTOR 8)
Morning, Claude.

CLAUDE
Morning, Crystal.

CRYSTAL
Morning, Mr. Mayor.

CLAUDE
Dwight.

DWIGHT
Morning Claude. Garth. Crystal.

DOUG
Claude. Crystal. Dwight. Garth. Morning.

CRYSTAL
Morning, b'ys. Pepsi?

CLAUDE
That's right, Crystal. What's the news? School bus strike still on?

DWIGHT
Ahya. We're working it out.

GARTH
Well, we're coming to the table.

CLAUDE
Well, we're coming to the table too.

DWIGHT
Are they tearing down the airport?

CLAUDE
Not today.

DOUG
(changing the subject)
I heard Don Burton and his wife won the Super 7!

CLAUDE
You don't say.

DWIGHT
Lucky shit.

DOUG
4.6 million.

THEY all whistle. JANICE enters.

JANICE
Excuse me, I'm looking for the Mayor.

EVERYONE points at CLAUDE.

JANICE (CONT'D)
Mister Mayor —I'm Janice Mosher with Rogers TV. I'm new. To town—and new to reporting. It's my first day.

CLAUDE
Where you longs to, Janice?

JANICE
Port Aux Basque. So if you see me running red lights or anything, just forgive me because we don't have stop lights over there.

CLAUDE
Well welcome to Gander, Janice.

DWIGHT
Janice.

GARTH
Janice.

DOUG
Janice.

CRYSTAL
Janice.

CLAUDE
If you're looking for news, you should talk to that man running in here. That's our constable, Oz Fudge. He's full of stories.

OZ runs in.

OZ
Mister Mayor, I saw your car in the lot. Crystal, turn up the radio so's we all can hear. Doug, you probably want to get down to Air Traffic Control right away.

DOUG
There's only supposed to be two air traffic controllers on, but instead there's fourteen... Everyone's heard and they all shows up without even being asked. We're told there'll be over 200 planes getting diverted across the country.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)
Ladies and Gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Looks like we'll be making an unexpected landing in Gander, Newfoundland.

The PASSENGERS start murmuring restlessly. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns to the audience, and the PASSENGERS freeze.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Anybody in the business knows when you set down in Gander, it's for an emergency. Now, we don't know what's going on, but the Captain tells us to keep everyone from panicking.

The FLIGHT ATTENDANT turns back, as the PASSENGERS unfreeze.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Tray tables up, please. We will be dimming the lights in the cabin. Pushing the light-bulb button will turn your reading light on; however, pushing the flight-attendant button will not turn your flight attendant on.
