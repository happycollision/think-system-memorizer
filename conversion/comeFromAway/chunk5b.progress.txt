DIANE
Did I kiss the fish?
HE looks at her, surprised.
Don’t you-? ...Yes, you did.
NICK
DIANE
Oh good... Wait—
NICK
We’re running out of time. Our plane could be the next one to go.
KEVIN T turns to KEVIN J.
KEVIN T
Our plane could be the next one to go. ...Are you still upset that I kissed a fish?
KEVIN J
No. I’m upset that I left the bar and you didn’t even notice!
KEVIN T
You left without telling me—
KEVIN J
After everything that’s happened. You're out there acting like it’s okay. And it’s not
okay.
KEVIN T
I know. But I’m not gonna shut myself inside. Let’s just get back to LA.

DIANE
While you’re in Dallas, I’d love to have you over.
KEVIN J
I tried to change my flight to New York. They wouldn’t do it.
NICK
My conference was cancelled. So, I head back to London immediately.
KEVIN T
I don’t understand. Why would you...?
KEVIN J
I just need to be back home.
NICK
Back home.
DIANE
Back home.
KEVIN T
Back home.
ALL FOUR are silent.
NICK
(sadly)
Well. All good things, right?

As the plane people leave, they keep stopping us, thanking us, trying to give us
money, but we say...
OZ
No, buddy. You. would’ve done the same.
ANNETTE
But one guy keeps insisting till Beulah finally tells him...
BEULAH

happy with a thank you on your way out.
ANNETTE

round up his passengers.

BOB
We get down to the airport —and it's chaos. Passengers dropped off from multiple
flights. Every bag has to be emptied.
OZ
No scissors. No nail clippers. If any bags are unidentified, they'll be blown up.
BOB
Then, someone says there’s issues with security.
BEVERLEY steps forward.
BEVERLEY
One of my flight attendants comes to find me. She says...
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
There’s a Muslim man on our flight —
ALI steps forward.
I saw him praying —and and...
he’s been acting... suspicious. He doesn’t have a carry-on...
I'm not getting back on that plane with him.
ALI
| arrive at the airport and am pulled out of line.
BEVERLEY
I am responsible for the safety of my passengers and my crew. And security tells me
any perceived threats must be taken extremely seriously.
They bring me to a private room and he is brought in for questioning.
ALI
At first I do not understand what the police are asking. And then I do.
In my culture, there is a word— “awrah” —the area between your stomach and your
knees. It is forbidden in my religion for anyone to see this but my wife.
To have a woman in the room, watching this. Watching me. You can’t understand.
BEVERLEY
It is the most thorough body search I’ve ever witnessed. And when it’s over, I find
him and I tell him—I am so very sorry that happened.
ALI
(barely looking at her)
Am I free to go now?
BEVERLEY nods.
ACTOR 11
When are we leaving?!
The CROWD jumps in with questions about leaving, pulling BEVERLEY away.
