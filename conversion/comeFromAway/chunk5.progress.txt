.Scene 27

KEVIN T
Everywhere you look, there are people from around the globe. Going back and forth for phones — or showers. Grabbing something from Shoppers. I’m getting coffee at a gas station on the main drag —and suddenly the entire place goes quiet...

# Song 72: Before Prayer

EVERYONE on stage stands still. KEVIN turns around, looking.

And nobody moves. Even the people outside are standing still. And I look up at the TVs and realize —it’s a national moment of silence in America. And all of these Newfoundlanders—these people from another country—they maintain that moment of silence. I don’t know if that would happen back home—at a busy gas station on the main drag—but it happened here.

HANNAH
Beulah walks me to church—and when we get there, I light a candle for my son.

BEULAH
And I do too.

KEVIN T
I suddenly realized what that music was from my dream —it was an old hymn from when I was a kid. Now, I haven’t been to church in years, but for some reason that song was in my head.

~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there is hatred, let me bring your love,
~Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,
~And where there's doubt true faith in you.

HANNAH
~Make me a channel of your peace

KEVIN T
~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there's despair in life,
~Let me bring hope, where there's despair in life,
~Let me bring hope
~Where there is darkness,
~Only light, where there is darkness,
~Only light,
~And where there's sadness,
~Ever joy, ever joy

RABBI
~Oseh shalom bim’romav
~Hu ya’aseh shalom aleinu
~V'al kol Yisrael
~V'imru, v'imru amen

There is a man here in town. He’s lived here nearly his entire life. He heard that there was a Rabbi diverted here and he came to find me and tell me his story.

EDDIE (ACTOR 11)
I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents—they were Jews—they sent me here before the war started. I still remember some prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was told I should never tell anyone that I was Jewish—even my wife. But after what happened on Tuesday—so many stories gone—just like that. I needed to tell someone.

ALI (ACTOR 9)
During El-Fajr, when most people are asleep it is easier to pray. But at El-Dhuhr, I can feel them watching me. Sometimes I catch them when they think I’m not looking—and I can see the fear in their eyes.

ANNETTE
Excuse me? Beulah wanted me to check on you. The library’s open—for anyone looking for some peace—and a quiet place to pray.

ALI lays out a prayer mat and begins to pray.

RABBI & EDDIE (hesitantly)
~Ya'aseh shalom (ya’aseh)
~Ya'aseh shalom (shalom)
~Shalom aleinu v'al kol Yisrael
~Ya'aseh shalom (ya’aseh)
~Ya'aseh shalom (shalom)
~Shalom aleinu v'al kol Yisrael

BEULAH, HANNAH, JEWISH PASSENGERS, HINDU PASSENGERS, KEVIN T & SINGER 10
~O master, grant that oseh shalom bim’romav asato maa
~I may never seek hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu sad-gamaya
~So much to be v'ial kol Yisrael tamaso maa
~Consoled as to vimru amen jyotire-gamaya
~Console; passengers 1 & 6 mrityor-maa—
~To be understood as ya’aseh shalom mritan gamaya
~To understand, ya’aseh shalom om shaantih
~To be loved, as to ya'aseh shalom shalom shaantih
~Love with all my soul shaantih

Underneath the above prayers, ALI prays.

ALI
Allahu Akbar

ALI stands with hands at ears, bends over with hands on knees, on his knees.

ALI
Subbhaan Rabbi al Azeem

He puts his head down.

ALI
Allahu Akbar

He comes back up to kneeling. He puts his head down.

ALI
Subhaan Rabbia Al-Aala’

He comes back up to kneeling. He puts his head to the right then to the left. Stands and folds his prayer rug.

KEVIN T
~Make me a channel of your peace
~Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope
~Where there is darkness, only light
~And where there’s sadness, ever joy

# Song 8a: Bonnie in the Holds

BONNIE
Health Canada finally lets the animals off and quarantines them to Hangar One. It’s a big room with cats and dogs and chimpanzees and there’s barking, meowing — and then the chimps start imitating the dogs, and they're barking too. The phones are ringing off the hook with people, who want to see their pets... But they're not allowed anywhere near the planes.

BONNIE
And I'm worried about Unga, the pregnant Bonobo. All animals are affected badly by stress - not just humans.


.Scene 29

CLAUDE
Some people spend their days crammed inside — shoulder to shoulder with nothing to do but watch the news and wait for something to happen.

ALL
~On the edge

BEULAH
We've got the TVs going 24/7 in the cafeteria. And the more they watch, the more scared and angry they get.

ALL
~On the edge of the

OZ
Some of the Plane People haven't slept in three days. None of us have either—and we're jumping at our own shadows.

ALL
~On the edge of the world

BEULAH
Around suppertime on Thursday, people are waiting to use the phones and there's a fight in the hallway —

ALI (on the phone)
Ana Kwayiss. Alhamdulliallah. El aakl hena helw awi. Hagga Faw’a el wassif. Lekin, fee ness (naass), fee naass kateera hena, Be-yeboosooly akiny Irtakept gereema.

PASSENGER 11 (to ALI)
Hey. Hey! What the hell are you saying?

ALI
I beg your pardon?

PASSENGER 11
You celebrating this? You praying for your friends?

ALI (into the phone again)
MaaMa, Laazim ‘afil el sikha delwaa’ty —salaam. Bahibik —

PASSENGER 11 (to PASSENGER 8)
Why doesn’t he speak English?

ALI
Excuse me?

PASSENGER 8
You telling your Muslim friends where to bomb next?

ALI
This was not all Muslims! And I was not—

PASSENGER 11
Go back where you came from! I’m Muslim and I was born in Connecticut!

PASSENGER 2
She’s an American citizen.

PASSENGER 11
You don’t look American. You —

PASSENGER 2
What does that even mean?

BEULAH
Sir, stop it!

PASSENGER 11
What did you say?

ALI
We haven’t done anything!

PASSENGER 10
They haven’t done anything!

PASSENGER 8
I’m not waiting till you do down!

BEULAH
Everyone calm down!

PASSENGER 6
That's right! Leave him alone!

PASSENGER 12
I've got a family to protect.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
They should question all you people!

PASSENGER 11
The bible says an eye for an eye! An eye for an eye!

ALL
~On the edge of the world or wherever we are
~We are—we are—we are on the edge
~Is there something—I need to do something
~To keep me from thinking of all of those scenes on the tube
~I need something to do—cause I can’t watch the news
~No I can’t watch the news anymore
~On the edge

CLAUDE
The FAA keeps delaying opening the airspace—and here on the ground, we're dealing with a whole mess of other problems.

ALL
~On the edge of the

BEVERLEY
Some of the planes are parked on a runway where the surface is all torn up. That debris gets into an engine and they'll never leave.

ALL
~On the edge of the world

DOUG
One of the big planes—a triple 7—is sinking into the asphalt. If we don’t do something, she'll be stuck here forever.

ALL
~On the edge of the world or wherever we are
~We are—we are—we are on the
~Are—we are—we are—we are on the edge!

JANICE
I interview a woman from Queens—a mother. Her son is a firefighter and they still can’t account for him. She starts crying and I start crying too. And I can’t stop shaking. I don't know if I can do this anymore.

BEVERLEY
I check in with Air Traffic Control again and it’s more bad news. Not only is the airspace still closed, but there’s a storm headed for Newfoundland. Hurricane Erin is making landfall by tomorrow or the day after. If we don’t get these planes in the air soon, no one’s going anywhere.

OZ
Claude, people are starting to crack.

CLAUDE
Let’s get everyone down to the Legion.

KEVIN T
Everyone’s going down to the Legion for a drink.

KEVIN J
Hi, have you seen my boyfriend? His name is Kevin, he’s about that tall, and he’s lost his mind.

KEVIN T
I just want to go out!

KEVIN J
Well, I don’t!

KEVIN T
Well, I'm not going without you.

KEVIN J
Well, I’m not... staying for a long time.

KEVIN T
One drink!

KEVIN J
One drink!

KEVIN T drags KEVIN J out the door.

BEULAH
Hannah? Everyone’s going out tonight.

HANNAH
You go on without me, Beulah... I need to wait by the phone.

BEULAH
I'll wait with you.

BEVERLEY
I keep waiting to hear from the airline. So I'll just be here by the phone, Tom, if the kids want to speak with me.

DOUG
Bonnie? I know you're not leaving the animals, so I brought you some chili. But I really think that tonight, you should come home and get some sleep...

BONNIE runs on.

BONNIE
Doug! Oh my—Get in here! We are about to have the first rare Bonobo chimpanzee born in Newfoundland!

OZ
Beulah! They need some food down at the Legion if you can spare any.

ALI
Miss Beulah. Please let me help with the food.

BEULAH
No, m’love. You're a guest—

ALI
Please. I am a master chef for an international hotel chain. I oversee restaurants around the world. I would like to help with the food.

BEULAH
Get in there!

BEULAH gestures emphatically toward the kitchen as ALI runs in, exasperated.

DIANE
Everyone’s going out to the bar—and Nick is going.

NICK
I'm going if Diane is going.

DIANE
And I think, nobody here knows me—I can be whoever I want to be...

BOB
I’m not worried about my wallet. I’m not worried about getting shot. I am a little worried about how much Irish Whiskey I'm drinking...

EVERYONE enters at the bar excitedly.
