Scene 27
KEVIN T
Everywhere you look, there are people from around the globe. Going back and forth
for phones — or showers. Grabbing something from Shoppers. I’m getting coffee at a
gas station on the main drag —and suddenly the entire place goes quiet...
#72 — Before Prayer
EVERYONE on stage stands still. KEVIN turns around, looking.
And nobody moves. Even the people outside are standing still. And I look up at the
TVs and realize —it’s a national moment of silence in America. And all of these
Newfoundlanders— these people from another country — they maintain that moment
of silence. I don’t know if that would happen back home —at a busy gas station on
the main drag — but it happened here.
HANNAH
Beulah walks me to church—and when we get there, I light a candle for my son.
BEULAH
And I do too.
KEVIN T
I suddenly realized what that music was from my dream —it was an old hymn from
when I was a kid. Now, I haven’t been to church in years, but for some reason that
song was in my head.
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
“WHERE THERE IS HATRED, LET ME BRING YOUR LOVE,
WHERE THERE IS INJURY, YOUR PARDON, LORD,
AND WHERE THERE'S DOUBT TRUE FAITH IN YOU.
HANNAH KEVIN T
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
WHERE THERE'S DESPAIR IN LIFE,
LET ME BRING HOPE, WHERE THERE'S DESPAIR IN LIFE,
LET ME BRING HOPE
WHERE THERE IS DARKNESS,
ONLY LIGHT, WHERE THERE IS DARKNESS,
ONLY LIGHT,
AND WHERE THERE'S SADNESS,
EVER JOY EVER JOY

V'IMRU, V'IMRU AMEN
There is a man here in town. He’s lived here nearly his entire life. He heard that
there was a Rabbi diverted here and he came to find me and tell me his story.
EDDIE (ACTOR 11)
I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents — they were Jews — they sent me here
before the war started —I still remember some prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was
told I should never tell anyone that I was Jewish—even my wife. But after what
happened on Tuesday —so many stories gone —just like that. I needed to tell someone.
ALI (ACTOR 9)
During El-Fajr, when most people are asleep it is easier to pray. But at El-Dhuhr, I
can feel them watching me. Sometimes I catch them when they think I’m not looking
—and I can see the fear in their eyes.
ANNETTE
Excuse me? Beulah wanted me to check on you. The library’s open —for anyone
looking for some peace —and a quiet place to pray.
ALI lays out a prayer mat and begins to pray.

Scene 28
#8a— Bonnie in the Holds
BONNIE
Health Canada finally lets the animals off and quarantines them to Hangar One. It’s
a big room with cats and dogs and chimpanzees and there’s barking, meowing — and
then the chimps start imitating the dogs, and they're barking too. The phones are
ringing off the hook with people, who want to see their pets...
But they're not allowed anywhere near the planes.
BONNIE
And I'm worried about Unga, the pregnant Bonobo. All animals are affected badly
by stress - not just humans.
Scene 29
CLAUDE
Some people spend their days crammed inside — shoulder to shoulder with nothing
to do but watch the news and wait for something to happen.

Some of the planes are parked on a runway where the surface is all torn up. That
debris gets into an engine and they'll never leave.

One of the big planes —a triple 7 —is sinking into the asphalt. If we don’t do
something, she'll be stuck here forever.

JANICE
I interview a woman from Queens —a mother. Her son is a firefighter and they still
can’t account for him. She starts crying and I start crying too. And I can’t stop
shaking. I don't know if I can do this anymore.
BEVERLEY
I check in with Air Traffic Control again and it’s more bad news. Not only is the
airspace still closed, but there’s a storm headed for Newfoundland. Hurricane Erin is
making landfall by tomorrow or the day after. If we don’t get these planes in the air
soon, no one’s going anywhere.
OZ
Claude, people are starting to crack.
CLAUDE
Let’s get everyone down to the Legion.
[[Page 81]]
KEVIN T
Everyone’s going down to the Legion for a drink.
KEVIN J
Hi, have you seen my boyfriend? His name is Kevin, he’s about that tall, and he’s
lost his mind.
KEVIN T
I just want to go out!
KEVIN J
Well, I don’t!
KEVIN T
Well, I'm not going without you.
KEVIN J
Well, I’m not... staying for a long time.
KEVIN T
One drink!
KEVIN J
One drink!
KEVIN T drags KEVIN J out the door.
BEULAH
Hannah? Everyone’s going out tonight.
HANNAH
You go on without me, Beulah... I need to wait by the phone.
BEULAH
I'll wait with you.
BEVERLEY
I keep waiting to hear from the airline. So I'll just be here by the phone, Tom, if the
kids want to speak with me.
DOUG
Bonnie? I know you're not leaving the animals, so I brought you some chili. But I
really think that tonight, you should come home and get some sleep...
BONNIE runs on.
BONNIE
Doug! Oh my —Get in here! We are about to have the first rare Bonobo chimpanzee
born in Newfoundland!

OZ
Beulah! They need some food down at the Legion if you can spare any.
ALI
Miss Beulah. Please let me help with the food.
BEULAH
No, m’love. You're a guest —
ALI
Please. 1am a master chef for an international hotel chain. 1 oversee restaurants
around the world. I would like to help with the food.
BEULAH
Get in there!
BEULAH gestures emphatically toward the kitchen as ALI runs in, exasperated.
DIANE
Everyone’s going out to the bar —and Nick is going.
NICK
I'm going if Diane is going.
DIANE
And I think, nobody here knows me—I can be whoever I want to be...
BOB
I’m not worried about my wallet. I’m not worried about getting shot. I am a little
worried about how much Irish Whiskey I'm drinking...
EVERYONE enters at the bar excitedly.
