SYNOPSIS
COME FROM AWAY tells the true story of when seven thousand people from
across America and around the world landed on the doorstep of Gander,
Newfoundland... and the people of Gander “put the kettle on.” When 38 planes
were diverted to a small, Canadian community on September 11th, 2001, the
town’s population doubled in an instant. While the world witnessed the worst acts
of humankind, the stranded passengers had their faith in humanity restored by the
spirited people who comforted those who had come from away.
