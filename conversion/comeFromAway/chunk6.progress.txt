BEVERLEY addresses her passengers.

BEVERLEY
Good morning. We are one of the first flights to leave...
The CROWD responds, relieved.
...which makes us one of the lucky ones as some planes may still be here for quite some time. Now, I have no control over this. You’ve paid for a flight from Paris to Dallas. If I get clearance, I will take you to Dallas. But if I am not cleared for Dallas, I have to take y’all back to France.
The CROWD starts murmuring.
But we will make arrangements as quickly as we can to get y’all back to the United States where you need to be.

CROWD 5
I can’t go back. I just adopted my daughter — we could lose her if we go back to Europe...

CROWD 5 ^
I could lose my daughter.

CROWD 10 ^
America is at war! I’m not going back to France.

KEVIN J ^
We've been here four days! How long are we going to be here?

KEVIN T ^
You have to take us home!

CROWD 12 ^
You said yourself — we paid for a ticket to Dallas — that’s where we should be taken.

CROWD 5 ^
We were trapped on our plane forever and then we've been here for days with no information and now you—what is wrong with you?

CROWD 10 ^
What is wrong with you? This is an International tragedy!

KEVIN J ^
Hey. Calm down. I’m sure they’re doing the best they can. If she says they’re going to get us home, then they’re going to get us home.

CROWD 11
Hey! Hey! We can vote on this. We can make them go where we want to go.

CROWD 11 ^
There’s over 200 of us—they'll take us where the majority of us wants to go. I'm serious — Hey. Hey!

CROWD 5
Well, who's for Dallas?

CROWD 11
Fuck that! Who’s for Switzerland?!

BEVERLEY
This is not a democracy! I am the captain and this is coming from American Airlines and the FAA. You are not voting on our destination. Now, if we have any situation that needs to be dealt with, we will be pulled out of line and we will be the last flight to leave.
The CROWD is quiet.
Thank you for your cooperation.

HANNAH
After hours of waiting, they tell us we're not leaving yet after all.

JANICE
4:18pm. There’s a 747 with a flat tire blocking the runway.
The PASSENGERS react to the news, groaning.
All planes are stopped. No one’s taking off.

# Song 11b: Dover Fault

All of the LOCALS jump up, still exhausted and surprised.

LOCAL 1
Hello! Welcome back.

LOCAL 2
I'll get your room ready.

BEULAH
I'll put the kettle on.

LOCAL 5
Welcome back. Come on in!

LOCAL 6 ^
Did you forget something?

LOCAL 8 ^
You've missed us.

LOCAL 9 ^
Get in here!

LOCAL 10 ^
Come on in!

LOCAL 11 ^
Hello! Hello! That was fast.

LOCAL 2 ^
You must've missed us. Come on in!

OZ ^

DIANE
We're told by our pilot to stay close to our shelters so we're ready to go again.

NICK
But Diane wants to take one last look around. And I can’t let her go by herself.

DIANE
And we find a gorgeous lookout: the Dover Fault.

DIANE stands on a chair and looks out.

NICK
(exhausted)
There’s about a million stairs.

DIANE
It’s beautiful. Nick! You've gotta see this.

HE steps up next to her and looks.

NICK
(looking)
Wow...

DIANE
I can’t believe we're here.

NICK
I know.

DIANE
I can’t believe we're leaving!

NICK
(quietly)
I don’t want to go.

DIANE
What did you say?

NICK
I don’t know. I'm—I'm going to get a picture or two.

DIANE
Oh, okay.

# Song 12: Stop the World

NICK turns to take a picture of her - and DIANE freezes.

NICK
~Stop the world
~Take a picture
~Try to capture
~To ensure this moment lasts
~We’re still in it
~But in a minute
~That’s the limit
~And this present will be past
~So here we are
~Where the world has come together
~So here she'll be
~In this picture forever

DIANE unfreezes.

DIANE
Look at this: Five hundred and forty million years ago, the continents of the world crashed together right here. And two hundred million years ago, they separated again, moving apart from each other.

NICK
Huh,

DIANE
But a little part of them was left behind.

NICK lifts his camera, pointing it at her.

DIANE
I should move. You’re missing all the scenery —

NICK
No, no. Stay where you are.

DIANE
Really?

NICK
Really. It’s perfect.

HE takes another picture and this time NICK freezes.

DIANE
~Stop the world
~Seize the moment
~But the minute he goes
~You're alone and it’s through
~Pinch yourself
~Tell yourself
~You’re just dreaming
~That means he’ll forget about you
~But here we are
~Where the continents once crashed together
~Before they went
~Their separate ways forever, so

DIANE (& NICK)
~Stop the world (stop the world)
~Stop the world (stop the world)
~Stop the world from spinning round

EVERYONE ELSE begins to sing underneath.

NICK & DIANE
~I'm on a lookout
~Overlooking something
~Worth taking the time
~To stop flying by
~And look down
~And look down
~Stop the world
~Stop being scared
~And look round
~And look round
~Stop the world
~Just tell her/him now and
~Aah
~Look now
~Aah!

DIANE & NICK
~Take a picture of the scenery
~Of a lookout
~Of a moment which is over
~Of the ocean of the river of the trees

They look at each other for a second and then turn away.

DIANE & NICK
~Stop the world please

CLAUDE
9:35am

ALL
~Saturday.

CLAUDE
September 15th. Finally, they get the planes going again —and I go down to tell the Wish Kids that they’re being sent home without getting to Disneyworld after all. But they’re not sad about it. They’re going on hayrides, canoe rides, and someone dresses up as the town mascot: Commander Gander. And it turns out that if they’d made it to Orlando, they would've got four days of rain.

# Song 12a: Goodbyes

BONNIE is alone in the hangar with the animals.

BONNIE
(to DOUG)
I'm just doing one more litter scoop, and then I'll get them on the planes!

SHE bends down to a carrier.
Lyle. You're a beautiful cat. I’ve taped your pill bottle to your carrier and made sure someone’ll see it. You did good. You’re going to be fine.

SHE moves along.
Ralph. You’re a good cocker spaniel. I know the night security crew ran you a bit ragged, so I want you to sleep on the plane, okay?

RALPH barks.

BONNIE
Okay.

SHE moves again.
... Unga... I’ve never met a rare Bonobo chimpanzee before. We don’t get many of them here in Newfoundland. And since your partner there likes to throw his own feces, I’m going to say that you are the nicest rare Bonobo chimpanzee I’ve ever met... And I want you to know that I’m sorry... I’m sorry that you lost your baby... I’ve got three, and some days they’re more trouble than they’re worth... Anyway. You're going to be okay.

# Song 12b: The Wind Picks Up

BEVERLEY
The winds start to pick up. 50 mile an hour winds. We’ve been here too long. We’re still on the ground and there’s a hurricane coming. And I’m thinking — we're running out of time. We have to leave. We have to leave now.

# Song 13: Somewhere in the Middle of Nowhere

ALL
~One plane then another and then
~Nine planes then another and then
~Thirteen planes then another (nineteen planes then another)
~Twenty-two — twenty-four — twenty-nine — thirty-two
~Thirty-eight thirty-eight thirty-eight
~Thirty-eight thirty-eight thirty-eight
~Thirty-eight thirty-eight thirty-eight
~Thirty thirty thirty-eight planes

On a plane, BEVERLEY makes an announcement.

BEVERLEY
~Ladies and gentlemen: if you look out your windows
~Underneath all that rain—is Maine
~We've just crossed the Canadian border
~Welcome back to the U.S. of A.

The PASSENGERS cheer.

BOB
~Looking out the window at the world underneath

DIANE
~And though he’s here next to me, in a second he'll go

KEVIN J
~Looking out the window

KEVIN T
Kevin, talk to me, please.

HANNAH
~And out the window we see

ALL
~A place we all know below

BEVERLEY hands BOB the microphone.

BOB
~Is this on? Oh, it’s on. Sorry, everyone — hi!
~Like most everyone, I am sorry saying goodbye
~So I wanted to thank them for all that they did
~So I’m doing just that —- and I’m passing a hat
~For the people who gave up their time
~And they gave up their town
~So let's give them a scholarship!
~Pass the hat down, cause

BOB holds up his Sou’wester hat and passes it along.

ALL
~Somewhere—in the middle of nowhere
~In the middle of who knows where (who knows where)
~There you’ll find (something in the middle of)
~Something — in the middle of nowhere
~In the middle of clear, blue air~ you found your heart but
~Left a part of you behind

DIANE
Nick and I sit together and I just want to say something, but we’re leaving... and it’s over...

NICK
And then she starts crying. And I don’t know what to say, so I just put my arm around her—and I go to kiss her on the forehead — to comfort her.

DIANE
Well, there was some turbulence — and honestly: I just thought he missed! So I—

SHE grabs NICK and kisses him.

BEVERLEY
~Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your window
~You won't want to miss this ~ we just entered Texas!

ALL
~Somewhere (somewhere) —in the middle of nowhere (nowhere)
~In the middle of who knows where (who knows where)
~There you'll find (something in the middle of)
~Something (something) —in the middle of nowhere (nowhere)
~In the middle of clear, blue air
~You found your heart
~But left a part of you behind

Everyone’s drinking and comparing stories.

Where did you stay? What did you do?

JOEY (ACTOR 7)

DELORES (ACTOR 4)

DIANE
But mostly Nick and I spend the plane ride home canoodling in the back.

NICK
At one point, a flight attendant comes ‘round saying...

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Hot towel? Hot towel?

SHE looks at Nick and Diane.
Cold towel?

CHORUS
~Somewhere in between
~(The pace of life and work)
~And where you’re going
~(Something makes you stop and notice)
~And you’re finally in the moment

ALL
~Somewhere —in the middle of nowhere
~In the middle of who knows where (who knows where)
~There you'll find
~Something (something) —in the middle of nowhere (nowhere)

BEVERLEY
~Ladies and gentlemen

ALL Except BEVERLEY
~Put your seat backs and
~Tray tables up
~Right below us is the city
~Where I grew up
~Coming ‘round past the
~Field, then the wheels
~Touch the ground home, America
~Taxiing, we're all cheering, home in America
~We're down!

(BEVERLEY)
~Thanking everyone — thank you for flying American!
~Hugging them
~Hugging my crew cause
~We're home again
~Past the gate up
~The stairs .
~And we're there and he's waiting in line

# Song 13a: Diane and Nick Say Goodbye

DIANE and NICK face each other.

DIANE
So...

NICK
SO...

DIANE
So you'll call?

NICK
As soon as I get back.

NICK & DIANE
And then he/she left
And then I was alone.
