Scene 35
BEVERLEY addresses her passengers.
BEVERLEY
Good morning. We are one of the first flights to leave...
The CROWD responds, relieved.
...which makes us one of the lucky ones as some planes may still be here for quite
some time. Now, I have no control over this. You’ve paid for a flight from Paris to
Dallas. If I get clearance, I will take you to Dallas. But if I am not cleared for Dallas, I
have to take y’all back to France.
The CROWD starts murmuring.
But we will make arrangements as quickly as we can to get y’all back to the United
States where you need to be.
CROWD 5
I can’t go back. I just adopted my daughter — we could lose her if we go back to
Europe...

CROWD 5
Well, who's for Dallas?
CROWD 11
Fuck that! Who’s for Switzerland?!
BEVERLEY
This is not a democracy! I am the captain and this is coming from American Airlines
and the FAA. You are not voting on our destination. Now, if we have any situation
that needs to be dealt with, we will be pulled out of line and we will be the last flight
to leave.
The CROWD is quiet
Thank you for your cooperation.
HANNAH
After hours of waiting, they tell us we're not leaving yet after all.
JANICE
4:18pm. There’s a 747 with a flat tire blocking the runway.
The PASSENGERS react to the news, groaning.
All planes are stopped. No one’s taking off.
#11b— Dover Fault
All of the LOCALS jump up, still exhausted and surprised.
LOCAL 1 LOCAL 2 BEULAH LOCAL 5
Hello! Welcome back. I'll get your room ready. I'll put the kettle on.

Scene 36
DIANE
We're told by our pilot to stay close to our shelters so we're ready to go again.
NICK
But Diane wants to take one last look around. And I can’t let her go by herself.
DIANE
And we find a gorgeous lookout: the Dover Fault.
DIANE stands on a chair and looks out.
NICK
(exhausted)
There’s about a million stairs.
DIANE
It’s beautiful. Nick! You've gotta see this.
HE steps up next to her and looks.
NICK
(looking)
Wow...
DIANE
I can’t believe we're here.
NICK
I know.
DIANE
I can’t believe we're leaving!
NICK
(quietly)
I don’t want to go.
DIANE
What did you say?
NICK
I don’t know. I'm—I'm going to get a picture or two.
DIANE
Oh, okay.
[[Page 103]]
#12-—Stop the World
NICK turns to take a picture of her -and DIANE freezes.
NICK
STOP THE WORLD
TAKE A PICTURE
TRY TO CAPTURE
* TO ENSURE THIS MOMENT LASTS
WE’RE STILL IN IT
BUT IN A MINUTE
THAT’S THE LIMIT
AND THIS PRESENT WILL BE PAST
SO HERE WE ARE
WHERE THE WORLD HAS COME TOGETHER
SO HERE SHE'LL BE
IN THIS PICTURE FOREVER
DIANE unfreezes
DIANE
Look at this: Five hundred and forty million years ago, the continents of the world
crashed together right here. And two hundred million years ago, they separated
again, moving apart from each other.
NICK
Huh,
DIANE
But a little part of them was left behind.
NICK lifts his camera, pointing it at her.
I should move. You’re missing all the scenery —
NICK
No, no. Stay where you are.
DIANE
Really?
NICK
Really. It’s perfect.
HE takes another picture and this time NICK freezes.
[[Page 104]]
DIANE
STOP THE WORLD
SEIZE THE MOMENT
BUT THE MINUTE HE GOES
YOU'RE ALONE AND IT’S THROUGH
PINCH YOURSELF
TELL YOURSELF
YOU’RE JUST DREAMING
THAT MEANS HE’LL FORGET ABOUT YOU
BUT HERE WE ARE
WHERE THE CONTINENTS ONCE CRASHED TOGETHER
BEFORE THEY WENT
THEIR SEPARATE WAYS FOREVER, SO
DIANE (& NICK)
STOP THE WORLD (STOP THE WORLD)
STOP THE WORLD (STOP THE WORLD)
STOP THE WORLD FROM SPINNING ROUND
EVERYONE ELSE begins to sing underneath.
NICK & DIANE EVERYONE ELSE
I'M ON A LOOKOUT OH...
OVERLOOKING SOMETHING
WORTH TAKING THE TIME
TO STOP FLYING BY
AND LOOK DOWN
AND LOOK DOWN
STOP THE WORLD
STOP BEING SCARED
AND LOOK ROUND
AND LOOK ROUND
STOP THE WORLD
JUST TELL HER/HIM NOW AND
AAH
LOOK NOW
AAH!
[[Page 105]]
DIANE & NICK
TAKE A PICTURE OF THE SCENERY
OF A LOOKOUT
OF A MOMENT WHICH IS OVER
OF THE OCEAN OF THE RIVER OF THE TREES
They look at each other for a second and then turn away.
STOP THE WORLD PLEASE

ALL
Saturday.
CLAUDE
September 15th. Finally, they get the planes going again —and I go down to tell the
Wish Kids that they’re being sent home without getting to Disneyworld after all. But
they’re not sad about it. They’re going on hayrides, canoe rides, and someone
dresses up as the town mascot: Commander Gander. And it turns out that if they’d
made it to Orlando, they would've got four days of rain.
#12a— Goodbyes
BONNIE is alone in the hangar with the animals.
BONNIE
(to DOUG)
I'm just doing one more litter scoop, and then I'll get them on the planes!
SHE bends down to a carrier.
Lyle. You're a beautiful cat. I’ve taped your pill bottle to your carrier and made sure
someone’ll see it. You did good. You’re going to be fine.
SHE moves along.
Ralph. You’re a good cocker spaniel. I know the night security crew ran you a bit
ragged, so I want you to sleep on the plane, okay?
RALPH barks.
Okay.
SHE moves again.
... Unga... I’ve never met a rare Bonobo chimpanzee before. We don’t get many of
them here in Newfoundland. And since your partner there likes to throw his own
feces, I’m going to say that you are the nicest rare Bonobo chimpanzee I’ve ever
met... And I want you to know that I’m sorry... I’m sorry that you lost your baby...
I’ve got three, and some days they’re more trouble than they’re worth... Anyway.
You're going to be okay.
#12b~—The Wind Picks Up
[[Page 107]]
BEVERLEY
The winds start to pick up. 50 mile an hour winds. We’ve been here too long. We’re
still on the ground and there’s a hurricane is coming. And I’m thinking — we're
running out of time. We have to leave. We have to leave now.

NICK
And then she starts crying. And J don’t know what to say, so I just put my arm
around her—~and I go to kiss her on the forehead ~— to comfort her.
DIANE
Well, there was some turbulence — and honestly: I just thought he missed! So I—
