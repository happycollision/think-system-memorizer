Scene 35
BEVERLEY addresses her passengers.
BEVERLEY
Good morning. We are one of the first flights to leave...
The CROWD responds, relieved.
...which makes us one of the lucky ones as some planes may still be here for quite
some time. Now, I have no control over this. You’ve paid for a flight from Paris to
Dallas. If I get clearance, I will take you to Dallas. But if I am not cleared for Dallas, I
have to take y’all back to France.
The CROWD starts murmuring.
But we will make arrangements as quickly as we can to get y’all back to the United
States where you need to be.
CROWD 5
I can’t go back. I just adopted my daughter — we could lose her if we go back to
Europe...

CROWD 5
Well, who's for Dallas?
CROWD 11
Fuck that! Who’s for Switzerland?!
BEVERLEY
This is not a democracy! I am the captain and this is coming from American Airlines
and the FAA. You are not voting on our destination. Now, if we have any situation
that needs to be dealt with, we will be pulled out of line and we will be the last flight
to leave.
The CROWD is quiet
Thank you for your cooperation.
HANNAH
After hours of waiting, they tell us we're not leaving yet after all.
JANICE
4:18pm. There’s a 747 with a flat tire blocking the runway.
The PASSENGERS react to the news, groaning.
All planes are stopped. No one’s taking off.
#11b— Dover Fault
All of the LOCALS jump up, still exhausted and surprised.

DIANE
We're told by our pilot to stay close to our shelters so we're ready to go again.
NICK
But Diane wants to take one last look around. And I can’t let her go by herself.
DIANE
And we find a gorgeous lookout: the Dover Fault.
DIANE stands on a chair and looks out.
NICK
(exhausted)
There’s about a million stairs.
DIANE
It’s beautiful. Nick! You've gotta see this.
HE steps up next to her and looks.
NICK
(looking)
Wow...
DIANE
I can’t believe we're here.
NICK
I know.
DIANE
I can’t believe we're leaving!
NICK
(quietly)
I don’t want to go.
DIANE
What did you say?
NICK
I don’t know. I'm—I'm going to get a picture or two.
DIANE
Oh, okay.
[[Page 103]]
#12-—Stop the World
NICK turns to take a picture of her -and DIANE freezes.
NICK

DIANE unfreezes
DIANE
Look at this: Five hundred and forty million years ago, the continents of the world
crashed together right here. And two hundred million years ago, they separated
again, moving apart from each other.
NICK
Huh,
DIANE
But a little part of them was left behind.
NICK lifts his camera, pointing it at her.
I should move. You’re missing all the scenery —
NICK
No, no. Stay where you are.
DIANE
Really?
NICK
Really. It’s perfect.
HE takes another picture and this time NICK freezes.

September 15th. Finally, they get the planes going again —and I go down to tell the
Wish Kids that they’re being sent home without getting to Disneyworld after all. But
they’re not sad about it. They’re going on hayrides, canoe rides, and someone
dresses up as the town mascot: Commander Gander. And it turns out that if they’d
made it to Orlando, they would've got four days of rain.
#12a— Goodbyes
BONNIE is alone in the hangar with the animals.
BONNIE
(to DOUG)
I'm just doing one more litter scoop, and then I'll get them on the planes!
SHE bends down to a carrier.
Lyle. You're a beautiful cat. I’ve taped your pill bottle to your carrier and made sure
someone’ll see it. You did good. You’re going to be fine.
SHE moves along.
Ralph. You’re a good cocker spaniel. I know the night security crew ran you a bit
ragged, so I want you to sleep on the plane, okay?
RALPH barks.
Okay.
SHE moves again.
... Unga... I’ve never met a rare Bonobo chimpanzee before. We don’t get many of
them here in Newfoundland. And since your partner there likes to throw his own
feces, I’m going to say that you are the nicest rare Bonobo chimpanzee I’ve ever
met... And I want you to know that I’m sorry... I’m sorry that you lost your baby...
I’ve got three, and some days they’re more trouble than they’re worth... Anyway.
You're going to be okay.
#12b~—The Wind Picks Up
[[Page 107]]
BEVERLEY
The winds start to pick up. 50 mile an hour winds. We’ve been here too long. We’re
still on the ground and there’s a hurricane is coming. And I’m thinking — we're
running out of time. We have to leave. We have to leave now.

September 16th. After five days, they just ran the zamboni over the ice. And played
hockey.
With the Plane People gone, I tell my staff “Go home, get some sleep.” We were all
exhausted —just spent — most of us had been up for five days straight working. But
somehow I can’t sleep, so I sit down and turn on the television. And I just start
crying. I hadn’t let myself cry the whole time.
ALL
SOMETHING'S GONE
BOB
Out the airplane window, I can see Manhattan and there’s still smoke. And suddenly
I'm afraid all over again—and there are others afraid too.
ALL
SOMETHING'S OVER
BOB
I know Newark airport. You could pull a truck over on the side of the turnpike and
shoot a grenade launcher at a plane coming in.

SOMETHING'S DONE

But nothing happens.
KEVIN T
I drive Kevin back to his place. We don't say much.

but... they still don’t know.

Kevin breaks up with me. And then he quits and moves back home to New York.
And I miss him. I miss his jokes.

Nick and I call each other when we can. But... it’s awful. The only reason we met
was because this terrible thing happened.

I go down to Ground Zero, which is like the end of the world. It’s literally still
burning.

SOMETHING'S NOT

My dad asks, “Were you ok out where you were stranded?” How do I tell him that I
wasn't just okay —I was so much better.
ALL
SOMETHING’S MISSING
BEVERLEY
I phone American and say, “I’m ready to go wherever you want to send me.” But
they say take a few days off. I phone every day and I am back at the airport by
Thursday. And it’s empty. Silent. It’s just —a different place. And I stop what few
passengers there are and I say, “Thank you for still flying.”
BEULAH answers the phone.
