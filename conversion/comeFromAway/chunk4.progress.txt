Scene 12
Meanwhile, in an airplane hold, BONNIE is searching with DOUG.
DOUG
I said, you've got five minutes, Bonnie!
In the background, a dog barks quietly.
BONNIE
There's hundreds of suitcases — I can hear barking — but I can't find them! They fast them before flying, so they're starving and they need water.
OFFICER STEPHENSON enters.
DWIGHT
Sir? Sir! Oh, Doug. You got to get out of there. We're keeping all personnel out of the
holds until —
DOUG
Sorry, Dwight. It’s the wife you know, Bonnie — from the SPCA — she’s feeding
some animals inside. Nothing’s coming off.
A cat meows.
BONNIE
I found a cat! His name is Lyle! There’s a pill taped to his carrier. Well I’m glad I got
in here to GIVE IT TO HIM! It’s okay, Lyle.
DWIGHT
Bonnie — I need you to get out of —
DOUG
Bonnie, you got to move your arse!
BONNIE
Doug, I have found ONE cat! Do you think it's LYLE who's barking?! (to Lyle)
Here's some crunchy, Lyle. I'll be back to give you your pill.

DOUG
(meekly underneath)
No...
DWIGHT
Listen to me — FAA sent over new orders — we're treating all U.S. planes as bomb
threats.
DOUG
Oh, god. Bonnie!
[[Page 41]]
BONNIE
Doug... Doug!
DOUG
What? Bonnie? Bonnie, talk to me!
BONNIE
Doug! There are monkeys on this plane.

Scene 13
#6b — Wheels on the Bus
Two bus drivers, MICKY and TERRY take a seat. They speak over their shoulders to
their passengers, as they shift into gear and drive.
TERRY (ACTOR 7)
Climb aboard.
MICKY (ACTOR 2)
Hop right in! You look some tired.
TERRY
Nothing to worry about now.
MICKY
We'll get you where you're going.
TERRY
I’m guessing you've never heard of Gander before. Well, that’s it in the rearview
mirror.
MICKY
You'll need to re-set your watches — we've got our own time zone here. Everything
happens half an hour later in Newfoundland.
TERRY
You've all seen the airport — used to be the biggest airport in North America. Planes used to stop here to gas up from everywhere.
MICKY
Frank Sinatra. Albert Einstein.
TERRY
Muhammad Ali.
BOTH
The Queen.
TERRY
This is where the Beatles first set foot in North America!
MICKY
And my father once went sledding with Fidel Castro!
TERRY
Then they invented jet planes that can get across the ocean on one tank...
[[Page 43]]
MICKY
So there's no need to refuel anymore...
TERRY
Leaving us with this giant airport.
There’s talk lately about tearing it down.
MICKY
TERRY
Lucky for you, we haven’t got around to it yet.
THEY brake suddenly, screeching.
MICKY
Now there’s the reason I drives slow.
TERRY
That there in the middle of the road.
MICKY & TERRY
Yeah. That's a moose.
EVERYONE faces forward, motionless.
An incredibly long pause.
Even longer than that.
MICKY
She’ll move when she’s good and ready.

#6c — Nick and Diane
On one of the busses, NICK approaches DIANE.
NICK
Mind if I sit here? The drunk people from our plane are snoring back there...
DIANE
Oh hello, Nick! Please do... I thought we'd lost you.
NICK
No —I just needed to get an emergency prescription filled -my medication is in my
suitcase. Nothing serious. Not like, “Ohmygod, he’s off his medication.” I'll stop
talking now.
DIANE
It’s fine.
NICK
It's heart medication. I've got a slight arrhythmia — nothing serious. There you go
—everything you need to know about me.
DIANE
Okay. I’m allergic to bananas and I have never had the chicken pox.
THEY both smile.
NICK
Any news yet about your husband who was flying today?
DIANE
My —? No — do you mind if we just don't talk about that. I haven't been able to get
to a phone.
NICK
I'm sorry. I’ll help you find a phone as soon as we get... wherever we're going.

GARTH
Now we rarely use them, but everyone’s dusted off their Salvation Army uniforms

There are soldiers everywhere.

GIZA NA MITI
GARTH
But then I notice his wife. Well, she’s clutching a bible. Now obviously I can’t read it,
but it'll have the same number system ours does — so I ask to see it and I'm searching
for something — and then in Philippians 4:6 — I give them their bible and I'm pointing
and saying, look! Philippians 4:6 - Be anxious for nothing. Be anxious for nothing.
GARTH & MUHUMUZA
And that’s how we started speaking the same language.

BEULAH
Welcome to Gander Academy — nicest hotel on the east coast, except for those with
actual beds. My name’s Beulah. Washrooms are just down the hall. There’s food over
there if you're hungry — and clothes, if you'd like to change. I’ll show you now
where you’re going to sleep. Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
EVERYONE surrounds BEULAH.
KEVIN J
So what really happened?
Well... what's the last thing you heard?
BEULAH
KEVIN J
There was an accident in New York.
BEULAH
Okay... I'm going to show you now to your rooms, and then if you want to come
back, we've got two TV's set up in the cafeteria with the news on — so you can see
what's actually happened for yourselves...
#6e — Lead Us Out Of The Darkness
JANICE
I didn’t even think — they haven’t seen any of it yet.
ALL
LEAD US OUT OF THE DARKNESS

HANNAH
We're all staring at those images.

BEULAH
And we just stand helpless watching them.
LEAD US SOMEWHERE TO SAFETY
BOB
We barely know where we are, but we know it's not there.

ALL
LEAD US FAR FROM DISASTER
[[Page 48]]
BEVERLEY
Charles Burlingame was the captain of Flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon. I
just saw him at a Pub in London. You can’t imagine. A pilot will fight to the ends of
the earth to save his airplane. He just will.
ALL
LEAD US OUT OF THE NIGHT
KEVIN T
We watch those images for hours.
THEY all stand and watch, unmoving. Suddenly THEY all react in shock.
Until someone finally turns it off.
CLAUDE holds up a remote control and turns off the TV.

#6f — Phoning Home
Crisis counselors are called to Gander Academy.
BEULAH
The plane people — they're exhausted — but they don't want to sleep. And we’re
standing there, ready with all that food. But that’s not what they wanted. They
wanted phones.
JANICE
1:45 am — Six phones are put on tables for the Plane People to use free of charge —
lined up alongside the road by the NEW-tel building.
BEULAH
An hour later, they setup 20 more phones.
CLAUDE
An hour after that, there's 75 phones and computers with internet — all being used
round the clock.
A number of PASSENGERS appear on telephones.
PASSENGER 5
HELLO? YES — IT'S ME.
BOB
DAD, I’M OKAY. IT’S OKAY.
PASSENGER 2
I’M CALLING FROM CANADA.

#7 — Costume Party
JANICE
3:45 am. Overnight, the community's population has gone from approximately 9,000
to 16,000. I’m sure barely any of us have slept tonight. We’re hopeful that our visitors
will be back in the air come morning.
KEVIN T
I woke up from a dream which I can’t quite remember, but there was this music in it
that I’d heard somewhere before.
KEVIN J
I woke up from a dream that we were stuck in some backwater Canadian town and
that my air mattress deflated.
BOB
I woke up to the smell of... freshly baked bread.
ANNETTE
4am in Newfoundland is breakfast time in Germany. And we’ve got a lot of
passengers here from Frankfurt, so breakfast starts at 4am and we start scrambling
eggs.
Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelettes.
BOB
DIANE
Fried Bologna.
NICK
Something called “toutans.”
KEVIN T .
I saw a casserole dish I don’t think I could lift.
BOB
They made enough food to feed 7,000 people. It’s like they never slept.
BEULAH
There’s this one man —from the Middle East — well, we don’t really know. Hasn’t
said a word to a soul — and some of the other passengers seem a bit wary of him. So,
it’s a little odd to find him poking around the kitchen.
ALI
(surprised)
Hello.

[[Page 52]]
BEULAH
Hello. Can I help you with something?
ALI
I would like to be of assistance with the food.
BEULAH
No. That’s not necessary.
ALI
But I am —
BEULAH
Really. You go out there and sit down.
CLAUDE
We've been going all night, but we can’t stop. I splash some cold water on my face
and just keep going. We’ve got 7,000 scared and angry people who don’t want to be
here. And they’re about to wake up.

DIANE
Any time now.
NICK
Is your hair different? I mean... you look good. I like it.
DIANE
Oh! Thank you. No shampoo for three days.
KEVIN T
They start handing out clothes to anyone who needs them.
KEVIN J
I haven't changed my clothes in 39 hours.
BOB
I wanted to burn my socks. .

Kevin puts on this plaid thing. He says he’s To it

Hey Little Sister — Yeah, still here where they eat rainbows for breakfast. Are you
taking care of mom? No. I’m just freaking out. I wish I was home. No, not LA.
Brooklyn. Shut up. You're such a brat. No. I just needed to hear your voice.
BEULAH approaches HANNAH.
BEULAH
Excuse me? Are you Hannah?
HANNAH
(expectant)
Yes — that’s me.
BEULAH
My name’s Beulah. Someone told me your son’s a firefighter... Mine is too. Here in
town. And I know Gander’s not New York, but... Is there anything I can do?

BEVERLEY
Good morning. I’m Captain Beverly Bass. Now I know this is going to be hard to
hear, but the American airspace remains closed. I can’t tell y’all how long we'll be on
the ground. We are going to be here for some time.
PASSENGERS react in shock.

DIANE
I can’t sit here. I need to get some air.
KEVIN T
Let’s go see where we are. It'll do you good.
KEVIN J
What'll do me good is to lie down and pretend this isn’t happening.
KEVIN T
Suit yourself.
HANNAH & KEVIN J

Scene 19
JANICE
By the middle of the day on Wednesday, I’m coordinating menus for 7,000 people.
(starts reporting)
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rotary Club is looking for some fish dishes. And we have
a bunch of German passengers down at the Moose Club who'd like to try elk... No,
sorry. That's the Elk's Club that's looking for moose. Sorry, I'm new.
BEULAH
Well if you won't try cod tongue, we got cheeseburgers - or we got hot dogs too —
and there's tuna casserole over there — or I could make you up a bologna sandwich?

KEVIN J
(to KEVIN T)
Are there vegetables in Canada?
KEVIN T
(to BEULAH)
We're vegetarians.
KEVIN J
I converted him.
KEVIN T
Anyway, I notice this other passenger who hasn’t eaten anything at all—
KEVIN J
Kevin's suddenly in everyone else’s business.
KEVIN T
So, I notify our hosts.
RABBI (ACTOR 7)
No. No, thank you. Please. I’m fine.
BEULAH
Turns out he’s an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi and he only eats Kosher food. Now, we
have all kinds of people living in Newfoundland: Protestants, Baptists, Catholics,
Salvation Army-ists — but not a lot of Jewish people.
RABBI
The next thing I know, I’m set up in the faculty lounge, making a Kosher kitchen for
any other Jewish passengers — but also for two Hindu women, some Muslims.
KEVIN T
And a couple vegetarians.

Scene 20
ANNETTE
One of the pilots for Virgin Atlantic — Captain Bristol —
#7a — Captain Bristol
He's a very strong leader. He's good to his passengers. And he's handsome too.
Anyway, he takes me aside and he says...
CAPTAIN BRISTOL (ACTOR 10)
(over the top romantic)
I've been watching you — you're doing beautiful work. I'd like you to be my personal
liaison and... work closely with me, helping to handle anything I might need.
BEULAH
Annette — what’ya on about? He did not say that.
ANNETTE
Well, he said something like that.
ALI approaches BEULAH, holding a bowl.
ALI
Miss Beulah? Hello.
BEULAH
(caught off guard)
Ah! ...Hello, Ali.
ALI
May I ask? This food. What is it?
BEULAH
(simply)
That's called Cod au Gratin.
; BEULAH
Fish with cheese. It’s fish. With cheese.
SHE walks away.
ALI
(calling after her)
...Are you sure I cannot help you with the food?
[[Page 59]]
CLAUDE
People start taking passengers back to their houses to get cleaned up and then
inviting them to dinner — and then putting them up in their guest rooms.
MARTHA (ACTOR 5)
Look, Misses. I’m just 20 weeks along and my Terry’s already set up the nursery, you
and your little one will be much more comfortable there.
BRITNEY (ACTOR 3)
Thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart. Would you like to come back to my house for
a shower?
BOB
People are saying ‘we want you to come to our house’. And I think, what is up with
this? I mean, are they charging for these “free” showers? Or are they gonna go all
Norman Bates... Anyway, I wasn’t falling for it. But finally, I’m invited back to the
Mayor of Appleton’s house — that sounds fancy, but it’s not~there’s a mayor for
every town of a thousand people in Newfoundland. There’s the Mayor of Gander
(he points to CLAUDE).
There’s the Mayor of Lewisporte
(CLAUDE puts on glasses).
There’s the Mayor of Gambo
(CLAUDE puts on a moustache).
Anyway, I’m staying with the Mayor of Appleton.
(CLAUDE puts on a hat, becoming DERM.)
DERM
Come on in, son. The Irish Whiskey’s in the bar downstairs.
BOB
His wife shows me where my bedroom is and where the shower is and through it
all, l keep thinking — where am I going to leave my wallet? Someone is gonna steal
my wallet.
KEVIN J
Someone says there’s a way out of here. They say there might be a boat —
KEVIN T
Kevin, we’re on the other side of the continent. We’re not taking a boat.
KEVIN J
So I stop an officer and ask him, “How do I get back home?”
BOB
Yeah, how do we get out of here?
[[Page 60]]
OZ
(quickly)
Well, you take a taxi to The Goose —there’s a bus there to Port Aux Basque, leaves
once a day, that’s about six hours. Once you're there, you take the ferry across the
Gulf, right? That's eight hours or so, then you catch another bus, not sure how often
they leave, but it’s another eight hours to Yarmouth where you can get another ferry
to the US Border, that's another four hours or so — and from Bar Harbor you should
be able to grab a Greyhound to wherever you need to go.
It’s about 2 or 3 days travel. But it’s sure a nice view.
[[Page 61]]
Scene 21
BEVERLEY
I don’t leave the hotel. I wait by the phone. Wait for someone to tell me we can fly
again. Planes aren’t made to just sit on the tarmac— planes are made to be in
constant motion. They arrive, you switch crew, you switch passengers, you empty
the honey buckets, and then the plane keeps going. When they sit still for too long,
well, it’s not good for ‘em. They start to break down.
#7b — It's Sure a Nice View
DIANE
Our pilot says we’re not leaving anytime soon, and Nick says...
NICK
I might get a picture or two before we go.
KEVIN T
I finally convince Kevin to go for a walk.
KEVIN J
There’s four of us to begin with. This Texan woman and this English guy with a
disposable camera and a huge stick up his ass.
KEVIN T
They’re nice enough...
(pointing at KEVIN)
Kevin and | are a little wary of telling people we’re together.
KEVIN J
I mean you just don’t know how redneck people can be.
DIANE
(happily)
This nice gay couple come along with us.
NICK
We kind of make small talk. They ask me what I do.
KEVIN J
He works for this oil company in England and she was there visiting with her son.
NICK
Wait... You've got a son?
[[Page 62]]
DIANE
Yes. David. The one who was flying on Tuesday.
KEVIN J
She goes on and on about England and how she didn’t get to travel when she was
married.
NICK
Wait... You're divorced?
DIANE
Yes. For a long time now.
KEVIN T
(to Nick)
What about you?
NICK
No. Not divorced, I mean... Not that I’m married! I’m neither. I travel a lot for
work —
KEVIN T
Kevin and I work for an environmental energy company. It’s my company — and
Kevin’s my secretary.
KEVIN J
I’m his secretary.
KEVIN T
Anyway — we do a lot of green work, so we generally hate people who work in oil.
NICK
I just got the feeling that they hated me.
DIANE
Then they want to go into some old building that looks like a shed. Now, they'd
heard it was a bar, but I wasn’t going into a bar in the middle of the afternoon with
three men I had just met.
NICK
And I think, I'll stay with Diane, you know, instead of the gay men who hate me.
THEY exit in opposite directions.

#7c — World's Largest Refrigerator
In an airplane hangar, BONNIE is feeding animals, as DOUG gets increasingly
frustrated.
BONNIE
Doug's helping me feed the animals — and after security checks each plane - slow as
cold molasses — we finally find eight dogs, nine cats — one of whom's epileptic — not
to mention two rare Bonobo chimpanzees! And the female Bonobo is pregnant.
We've got to get them off these planes!
(into the phone)
Hello? Is the Mayor there? It’s Bonnie Harris again. Yes, I'll hold.
DOUG
FAA was pretty clear about “No rare chimpanzees on Canadian soil.”
BONNIE hands a bucket to DOUG.
Doug. Take that.

BONNIE
What is that?

DOUG
It’s rare chimpanzee shit. What do you think it is?
(into the phone)
Yes? The mayor! Yes! I'll hold!

DOUG
(finally losing his patience)
I've got to get back to Air Traffic Control!

BONNIE
Doug — look up! Do you see anything flying?
DOUG
I can't see across the friggin' Atlantic!
BONNIE
Just get me more litter from the truck!

We're getting three more truckloads of food tonight —
STAFF 8
Stop them! We've got nowhere to put it!
STAFF 7
Well, then what do we feed people?

You need to talk to Health Canada

STAFF 8
Well cancel the effing food too!

Now there's five vats of chilli. My uncle has a truck

STAFF 1
That Rogers girl does NOT know what she's doing.

STAFF 2
Until further notice? What does that mean?
STAFF 12
We also need that girl at Rogers to announce that rotary, hockey, boys and girls club
—everything’s cancelled until further notice.
CLAUDE
Hold on. Did you just say that Hockey's cancelled?
A pause.
JANICE
3:47pm — The town is asking all bulk food deliveries be taken to the Gander
community center hockey rink. Since hockey’s cancelled, the Mayor is now calling
it...

#7d — Bar and Grills
In Gambo, KEVIN T and KEVIN J are at the bar.
KEVIN T
It’s hot outside, so we stay in the bar, and make small talk with Matty, the owner,
and his wife, Brenda—
KEVIN J
We're not sure how much to say — you just don't know where the red states are ina
foreign country, right?
KEVIN T
But we'd been drinking all afternoon and | accidentally say something like, Kevin
and I have been together for almost five years...
KEVIN J
(quickly)
In business. We've been together in business. I’m his secretary — His secretary!
The music stops as EVERYONE looks at them.
KEVIN T
And it feels like the entire bar goes silent —
KEVIN J
And I’m like... Oh, god.
KEVIN T
And then Matty says...
MATTY (ACTOR 7)
You're gay?
KEVIN J
And I’m about to pass out.
But then Matty says...
KEVIN T
Well, praise be to God. My daughter’s gay!
MATTY
KEVIN T
And then Brenda says...
[[Page 67]]
BRENDA (ACTOR 1)
Sure, my sister’s gay —and the woman across the road just ran off with her best
friend!
KEVIN T
And then Brenda’s brother says...
BRENDA’S BROTHER (ACTOR 11)
Our uncle is 68 years old and he just told us he’s a bi-sexual.
KEVIN T
We somehow ended up in the gayest town in Newfoundland. And Kevin and I are
looking at each other like —I think I even say, “There must be something in the
water.” And then Brenda’s brother says...
BRENDA’S BROTHER
That's why I only drink the beer.

BOB
Watching the news all day, some of us are starting to lose it. So these people here,
they decide to have a big cook out for the whole community —just trying to get our
minds off of everything. And Derm, the Mayor of Appleton, says to me...
DERM
Right, m’son, do me a favor and start to round up some grills.
BOB
Round up some grills?
DERM
Yeah, just go to people’s yards and take their grills.
A pause.
BOB
... Take their grills? Someone’s gonna shoot me.
DERM
No, no, no, no, no... Just go to people’s yards and grab their grill.
Another pause.
BOB
(to audience)
So I'm going from yard to yard and I keep thinking, someone is going to shoot me in the back.
MALE TOWNSPERSON (ACTOR 12)
Hello there!
BOB freezes.
Are you taking my barbecue?
... This is your barbecue?
MALE TOWNSPERSON
BOB
MALE TOWNSPERSON

BOB
Listen, [am so sorry —

MALE TOWNSPERSON
The wife’s got the kettle on, if you want a cuppa.
BOB
I get offered a cup a tea in every single backyard — and most of them offer to help
me steal their own barbecues. We bring them all over to the community center — no
names on them. I don’t know how they ever get “em back. But that’s how we have
a big cookout — completely free. After that I stop worrying so much about my
wallet.
JANICE
8:45 am.
ALL
Thursday.
JANICE
September 13th. We've got a... situation down at Gander Academy.
At the Academy, BEULAH and ANNETTE address everyone.
BEULAH
Ladies and Gentlemen. We have an indelicate request. We need volunteers to help
clean the bathrooms. As you can imagine, with 700 adults in a primary school...
Health Canada needs us to clean them every hour and a half and we just don’t
have the people. So, we're asking for your help.
A pause as EVERYONE looks away.
ANNETTE
But.no one volunteers.
BEULAH
No one comes. And we’re run off our feet with everything else. And then—
#7e — Cardiologists
ANNETTE
Sweet Jesus in the garden.
This line of men comes walking down the hall.
- Six men in doctor coats walk towards her in a slow motion burlesque. ANNETTE’s
jaw drops.
The top six cardiologists from all over the world. On their way to a conference.
Highly qualified cardiologists.
And they know about the importance of cleanliness.

CARDIOLOGIST (ACTOR 7)
If we don’t get these bathrooms clean, we’re going to have... bigger problems.
The CARDIOLOGISTS exit.

Scene 26
#7f — I Am Here
BEULAH
Anyway I get lunch set up, labeling anything that'll go bad with the date and time, I
let the pants out for one of the pilots who’s been enjoying our cooking. I make a
balloon animal for a crying toddler —and then I check on Hannah, talking to anyone
she can reach.
On the other side of the stage, HANNAH puts the phone to her ear,
HANNAH
1 AM HERE—I AM HERE ON AN ISLAND
HELLO? HELLO. IT’S ME AGAIN
YEAH, MY SON. HE’S WITH RESCUE TWO
ANY NEWS?
1 AM HIS MOTHER
I’M FAR AWAY —STUCK HERE
I’M TRYING TO FIND OUT —

PUTTING UP SIGNS

[[Page 72]]
(HANNAH)
WHEN HE COMES THROUGH THE DOOR
AND SAYS, “I’M HOME, MOM”
I SHOULD BE THERE FOR MY SON
BUT INSTEAD
IAM HERE
1AM HERE
BEULAH
She leaves message after message for her son— until there’s no more room on his
answering machine.
HANNAH
ALL I KNOW
IS YOU ARE THERE
YOU ARE THERE
AND 1 AM HERE
BEULAH
She finally got some news.
HANNAH
They said it was Kev's day off — but someone else said there were more men down
there than were scheduled.
I should be looking for him. He's always there for me — trying to make me laugh.
Tells me stupid jokes. He loves jokes — tells them to the kids at the firehouse, while
he fixes their bikes.
I should be there.
BEULAH
I know there’s nothing I can do to help. But I do know a few jokes. There was a
sailor who was stationed in the South Pacific, far away from his wife who he'd just
married. And when he was away, he wrote her a letter. He said, “We're going to be
apart for a long time —and this island is full of young, attractive native girls. I need
something to take my mind off them.”
So his wife sends him an accordion and says, “Why don’t you learn to play this
then?” So finally, he comes home from his tour of duty and says to his wife, “I can’t
wait to get you into bed.” And she says, “First let’s see how well you play that
accordion.”
SHE laughs at her own joke, but sees HANNAH 's face and stops.

HANNAH
That was a really stupid joke.
A pause.
Tell me another one.
