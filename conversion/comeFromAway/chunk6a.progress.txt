# Song 14: Something's Missing

JANICE
~Back to the way that things were

OZ
~Back to the simple and plain

DWIGHT
~For five days the weather had been so nice

BONNIE
~But as they boarded it started to rain

A moment, as they ALL look up.

BEULAH
~At the end of the day, after everyone left

OZ
~We all tried to go back to normal except

CLAUDE
~The town was more quiet and somehow far emptier

BONNIE
~We all looked the same, but we're different than we were

BEULAH
~The gym was a sight—as I stacked the last cot

DWIGHT
~Thank-you's written everywhere and things they forgot

CLAUDE
~The Board of Health says clean it up—every part

ALL
~So we start

CLAUDE
7:42 am.

ALL
Sunday.

CLAUDE
September 16th. After five days, they just ran the zamboni over the ice. And played hockey.

With the Plane People gone, I tell my staff "Go home, get some sleep." We were all exhausted—just spent—most of us had been up for five days straight working. But somehow I can't sleep, so I sit down and turn on the television. And I just start crying. I hadn't let myself cry the whole time.

ALL
~Something's gone

BOB
Out the airplane window, I can see Manhattan and there's still smoke. And suddenly I'm afraid all over again—and there are others afraid too.

ALL
~Something's over

BOB
I know Newark airport. You could pull a truck over on the side of the turnpike and shoot a grenade launcher at a plane coming in.

ALL
~Something's done

BOB
But nothing happens.

KEVIN T
I drive Kevin back to his place. We don't say much.

ALL
~Something's missing

HANNAH
I go straight to his firehouse. Part of me wondered if they just weren't telling me, but... they still don't know.

ALL
~Something's changed

NICK
My flat is the same as I left it. But emptier. Quieter. I start to unpack—and I find the camera.

ALL
~Something's rearranged

ALI
On the way to my restaurant, I drop my daughter at school, but she won't go in. She says she's scared. What do I tell her?

ALL
~Something's strained

BOB
Back at my dad's house—I look out the window—at this view I've looked at my whole life. And now a part of it—something's missing.

ALL
~Something's missing

KEVIN T
Kevin breaks up with me. And then he quits and moves back home to New York. And I miss him. I miss his jokes.

ALL
~Something's lost

DIANE
Nick and I call each other when we can. But... it's awful. The only reason we met was because this terrible thing happened.

ALL
~Some things cost

BOB
I go down to Ground Zero, which is like the end of the world. It's literally still burning.

ALL
~Something's not

BOB
My dad asks, "Were you ok out where you were stranded?" How do I tell him that I wasn't just okay—I was so much better.

ALL
~Something's missing

BEVERLEY
I phone American and say, "I'm ready to go wherever you want to send me." But they say take a few days off. I phone every day and I am back at the airport by Thursday. And it's empty. Silent. It's just—a different place. And I stop what few passengers there are and I say, "Thank you for still flying."

BEULAH answers the phone.

BEULAH
Hello. You've reached the Gander Academy, this is Beulah Davis. How can I help

HANNAH
...He's gone. It's over.

BEULAH
...Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Hannah. I'm so sorry.

HANNAH
~You are here
~At the end of a moment
~At the end of the world
~You are here
~On the edge of the ocean
~Where the story ends
~Here

BEULAH
~Where the river meets the sea

EVERYONE ELSE
~Something's gone
~Something's over

NICK
~Across the Atlantic

KEVIN T
~At the office

BEVERLEY
~In an airport

DIANE
~In my house

BOB
~On an island

BEULAH
~In a classroom

EVERYONE ELSE
~Something's rearranged

JANICE
~At the station

OZ
~In my car

ALL
~And wherever you are (something's gone)
~You are here

.Scene 40

JANICE
When Gander town council declares the state of emergency over, it means that everything goes back to normal.

JANICE rolls her eyes as she moves to reveal CLAUDE and GARTH.

CLAUDE
Garth.

GARTH
Claude.

CLAUDE
Look.

GARTH
Look at it from my perspective.

CLAUDE
We've been coming to the table.

Look.

CLAUDE
Will you look at it from MY perspective?

We've been coming to the table too.

Are they tearing down the airport?

CLAUDE
Not today.

OZ runs in.

Mister Mayor, I saw your car in the lot. You might want to get down to Town Hall. We just opened the suggestion box.

# Song 15: Epilogue

CLAUDE
When the bank finally converted all the currency from around the world—people had donated over sixty thousand dollars.

EVERYONE whistles.

ANNETTE
Every day for months, passengers sent back chocolates, flowers...

BEULAH
Donations of all kinds.

CLAUDE
Postcards and letters came in from everywhere.

BEULAH opens a letter as ALI reads.

ALI
Dear Miss Beulah. When my daughter asks about what happened to me over those five days, I tell her about your kindness. Thank you again. Sincerely, Ali. PS., please send me the recipe for the fish and the cheese.

BONNIE and DOUG step forward.

BONNIE
Ralph, the cocker spaniel, went on to become a champion show dog!

DOUG
And Unga the rare Bonobo chimpanzee arrived safely at the Columbus Zoo.

BONNIE
And soon after, she had a baby—which they named Gander.

JANICE steps forward.

JANICE
Tom Brokaw phones me. Tom Brokaw. He's doing a documentary—and since I was the only reporter in town—I'm the only one with any footage. Tom. Brokaw.

It was a big break—but I didn't really like shoving microphones into people's faces when they were going through so much. So, I stayed here in Gander—and I'm still here today—on the tenth anniversary.

REPORTERS from around the world overlap.

REPORTER 9
I'm reporting live from Newfoundland for BBC.

CBC.

REPORTER 7
CTV.

For Rogers TV, I'm Janice Mosher—on September 11th.

MEN

GARTH
~Where everything is meant to be, but nothing goes as planned

OZ
~And the drunkest fellas in the room are playing in the band

The band rocks out onstage.

ALL

A REPORTER is interviewing BEVERLEY.

BEVERLEY
With all the new security, kids aren't even allowed up in the cockpit anymore. Of course on my retirement flight, I brought my whole family up to the cockpit, on our way back to Gander.

BOB
I came back with the scholarship money we raised—now worth over a million dollars.

DERM
I bring out the Irish whiskey and we have ourselves a toast.

A REPORTER is interviewing DIANE.

DIANE
Nick and I just couldn't make the long distance relationship work.

NICK joins the interview.

NICK
So, I moved to Texas—and then I proposed!

DIANE
And we honeymooned in Newfoundland.

A REPORTER is interviewing KEVIN T.

KEVIN T
My new secretary's name is Robin.

ROBIN (ACTOR 10)
What's up?

KEVIN T
Every year on September 11th, I close my office and give each employee 100 dollars to go and do random good deeds for strangers. It's my way of remembering what happened.

A REPORTER is interviewing HANNAH and BEULAH.

HANNAH
Beulah and I still keep in touch. She even came to visit me in New York—and I phone her if I hear a really stupid joke. Hey, Beulah. Why are Newfoundlanders terrible at knock knock jokes?

BEULAH
I don't know, Hannah.

HANNAH
Well, try it. I'll be a Newfoundlander.

BEULAH
Knock knock.

HANNAH
Come on in—the door's open!

BEULAH laughs. JANICE is interviewing OZ.

JANICE
The donation we are most honored by just arrived today.

OZ
It's about four meters long and 12,000 kilograms.

JANICE
Newfoundland is the only place outside of the United States, where we share the steel from the World Trade Center.

CLAUDE steps forward

CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there's an airport—and next to it, is a town called Gander.

Tonight, we honor what was lost. But we also commemorate what we found!

ALL
~You are here
~At the start of a moment
~On the edge of the world
~Where the river meets the sea
~Here on the edge of the Atlantic
~On an island in between

GROUP 1
~There and here
~There and here
~There and here
~I'm an islander - I am an islander
~I'm an islander - I am an islander
~I'm an islander - I am an islander
~I'm an islander - I am an islander
~I'm an islander - I am an islander

The WOMEN continue underneath.

MEN (Overtop)
~Welcome to the fog
~Welcome to the trees
~A kiss—and a cod
~And whatever's in between
~To the ones who've left
~You're never truly gone
~A candle's in the window
~And the kettle's always on
~To the coves and the caves
~And the people from the planes

CLAUDE
~5 days!

BONNIE
~19 animals!

BEULAH
~And 7,000 strays!

MEN (Overtop)
~When the sun is setting
~And it's darker than before
~If you're hoping for a harbour
~Then you'll find an open door
~In the winter from the water
~Through whatever's in the way
~To the ones who have come from away, we say

ALL
~Welcome to the—welcome to the
~Welcome to the~welcome to the
~Welcome to the—welcome to the—welcome to the rock!
