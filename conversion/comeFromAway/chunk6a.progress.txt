CLAUDE
September 16th. After five days, they just ran the zamboni over the ice. And played
hockey.
With the Plane People gone, I tell my staff “Go home, get some sleep.” We were all
exhausted —just spent — most of us had been up for five days straight working. But
somehow I can’t sleep, so I sit down and turn on the television. And I just start
crying. I hadn’t let myself cry the whole time.
ALL
SOMETHING'S GONE
BOB
Out the airplane window, I can see Manhattan and there’s still smoke. And suddenly
I'm afraid all over again—and there are others afraid too.
ALL
SOMETHING'S OVER
BOB
I know Newark airport. You could pull a truck over on the side of the turnpike and
shoot a grenade launcher at a plane coming in.
ALL
SOMETHING'S DONE
BOB
But nothing happens.
KEVIN T
I drive Kevin back to his place. We don't say much.
ALL
SOMETHING'S MISSING
HANNAH
I go straight to his firehouse. Part of me wondered if they just weren’t telling me,
but... they still don’t know.
ALL
SOMETHING'S CHANGED
NICK
My flat is the same as I left it. But emptier. Quieter. I start to unpack—and I find the
camera.
ALL
SOMETHING’S REARRANGED
[[Page 114]]
ALI
On the way to my restaurant, I drop my daughter at school, but she won't go in. She
says she’s scared. What do I tell her?
ALL
SOMETHING'S STRAINED
BOB
Back at my dad's house —I look out the window- at this view I’ve looked at my
whole life. And now a part of it~something’s missing.
ALL
SOMETHING'S MISSING
KEVIN T
Kevin breaks up with me. And then he quits and moves back home to New York.
And I miss him. I miss his jokes.
ALL
SOMETHING'S LOST
DIANE
Nick and I call each other when we can. But... it’s awful. The only reason we met
was because this terrible thing happened.
ALL
SOME THINGS COST
BOB
I go down to Ground Zero, which is like the end of the world. It’s literally still
burning.
ALL
SOMETHING'S NOT
BOB
My dad asks, “Were you ok out where you were stranded?” How do I tell him that I
wasn't just okay —I was so much better.
ALL
SOMETHING’S MISSING
BEVERLEY
I phone American and say, “I’m ready to go wherever you want to send me.” But
they say take a few days off. I phone every day and I am back at the airport by
Thursday. And it’s empty. Silent. It’s just —a different place. And I stop what few
passengers there are and I say, “Thank you for still flying.”
BEULAH answers the phone.
[[Page 115]]
BEULAH
Hello. You’ve reached the Gander Academy, this is Beulah Davis. How can I help
HANNAH
...He’s gone. It’s over.
BEULAH
....Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Hannah. I'm so sorry.

JANICE
When Gander town council declares the state of emergency over, it means that
everything goes back to normal.

Mister Mayor, I saw your car in the lot. You might want to get down to Town Hall.
We just opened the suggestion box.

#15— Epilogue
CLAUDE
When the bank finally converted all the currency from around the world — people
had donated over sixty thousand dollars.
EVERYONE whistles.
ANNETTE
Every day for months, passengers sent back chocolates, flowers...
BEULAH
Donations of all kinds.
CLAUDE
Postcards and letters came in from everywhere.
BEULAH opens a letter as ALI reads.
ALI
Dear Miss Beulah. When my daughter asks about what happened to me over those
five days, I tell her about your kindness. Thank you again. Sincerely, Ali. PS., please
send me the recipe for the fish and the cheese.
BONNIE and DOUG step forward.
BONNIE
Ralph, the cocker spaniel, went on to become a champion show dog!
DOUG
And Unga the rare Bonobo chimpanzee arrived safely at the Columbus Zoo.
BONNIE
And soon after, she had a baby - which they named Gander.
JANICE steps forward.
JANICE
Tom Brokaw phones me. Tom Brokaw. He’s doing a documentary —and since I was
the only reporter in town—I’m the only one with any footage.
Tom. Brokaw.
It was a big break —but I didn’t really like shoving microphones into people’s faces
when they were going through so much. So, I stayed here in Gander—and I'm still
here today — on the tenth anniversary.

A REPORTER is interviewing BEVERLEY.
BEVERLEY
With all the new security, kids aren’t even allowed up in the cockpit anymore. Of
course on my retirement flight, I brought my whole family up to the cockpit, on our
way back to Gander.
BOB
I came back with the scholarship money we raised —now worth over a million
dollars.
DERM
I bring out the Irish whiskey and we have ourselves a toast.
A REPORTER is interviewing DIANE.
DIANE
Nick and I just couldn’t make the long distance relationship work.
NICK joins the interview.
So, I moved to Texas — and then I proposed!
And we honeymooned in Newfoundland.
A REPORTER is interviewing KEVIN T.
NICK

KEVIN T
My new secretary’s name is Robin.

ROBIN (ACTOR 10)
What's up?
KEVIN T
Every year on September 11th, I close my office and give each employee 100 dollars
to go and do random good deeds for strangers. It’s my way of remembering what
happened.
A REPORTER is interviewing HANNAH and BEULAH.
HANNAH
Beulah and I still keep in touch. She even came to visit me in New York —and I phone her if I hear a really stupid joke. Hey, Beulah. Why are Newfoundlanders
terrible at knock knock jokes?
BEULAH
I don’t know, Hannah.
HANNAH
Well, try it. I'll be a Newfoundlander.
BEULAH
Knock knock.
HANNAH
Come on in—the door’s open!
BEULAH laughs. JANICE is interviewing OZ.
JANICE
The donation we are most honored by just arrived today.
OZ
It’s about four meters long and 12,000 kilograms.
JANICE
Newfoundland is the only place outside of the United States, where we share the
steel from the World Trade Center.
CLAUDE steps forward
CLAUDE
On the northeast tip of North America, on an island called Newfoundland, there’s an
airport —and next to it, is a town called Gander.
Tonight, we honor what was lost. But we also commemorate what we found!
