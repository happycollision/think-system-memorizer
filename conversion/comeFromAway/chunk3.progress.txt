.Scene 5

Everyone become PASSENGERS, facing sideways. One of the passengers, DIANE, turns out the window.

DIANE  
I look out the window to see if there’s something mechanical —like if we've lost an engine or if something’s on fire. But I don’t see anything.

Another passenger, NICK, turns out his window.

NICK  
I told head office I need to travel less —I told them it was doctor’s orders. But they say, “You're going to the conference,” so you go.

BOB turns out his window.

BOB  
My dad is always saying, Bob, you've got to calm down. But the flight attendant is shaking like a leaf, so I figure I’ve got permission.

HANNAH turns out her window.

HANNAH  
My son sends me on this vacation—he says, “Mom, you've never gone anywhere.” And when I get back, I'm telling him — this is exactly why.

KEVIN T turns out his window.

KEVIN T  
Suddenly, there's a drop.

The GROUP drops, with a gasp.

A sudden change in direction. And I fly a lot, so I know that's not normal. Outside the window, all I can see below are trees and rocks and... nothing.

.Scene 6

BEVERLEY  
On final approach, we're coming into runway two-two, and I think, "Where am I going to park this thing?" There are planes lined up like sardines. And as far as I can see there’s cars lined up too. It looks like everybody in Newfoundland is here.

The TOWNSPEOPLE stand looking upward.

JANICE  
Is this on? Sorry. I’m new. This is Rogers TV Channel 9. My name is Janice Mosher and I'm reporting live from Gander Airport where the 19th plane has just touched down. I'm here with...

BONNIE  
Bonnie Harris. On a normal day, we get a half dozen flights, and now we've already got three times that many landing in two hours. It’s a lot of noise. You can smell the fuel. You can smell the exhaust.

OZ  
Jaysus, that’s a jumbo! There’s gotta be two-fifty or three hundred on her. That's a fairly large one, there’s gotta be two hundred on her- now, I’m adding this up. We got 38 planes — we got two, three hundred people on the average...

ALL Unless Speaking  
~Thirty-eight, thirty-eight

OZ  
Holy shit!

.Scene 7

At the Town Hall, everyone becomes STAFF who shout for CLAUDE as he enters, trailed by JANICE.

STAFF STAFF STAFF STAFF STAFF  
Claude! Excuse me. Claude! The Claude? Mister Mayor? Phones are ringing off the hook!

STAFF  
Mister Mayor! Claude! I just need to talk to you. Heard from Ottawa.

CLAUDE whistles for attention and points to STAFF 10.

STAFF 10  
Air traffic control says five of the planes on the ground aren’t responding.

STAFF 9  
Reg says they're probably just on the wrong frequency.

CLAUDE  
Thank you, Dwight.

STAFF 12  
FAA won't give us a timeline for reopening the airspace.

STAFF 9  
And the airplane crews need to be rested or we'll never get them out of here.

STAFF 7 (OZ)  
American Transatlantic flight number 25 is requesting that when they deplane, they be a priority...

CLAUDE  
Why?

STAFF 7 (OZ)  
They were headed to Disneyworld with 90 Wish Kids.

CLAUDE  
Oh, Jaysus.

STAFF 6  
Even with all the hotels in town, we've got no room—we gotta start looking at other towns.

STAFF 5  
Appleton and Gambo have already offered—but we can’t get them there.

STAFF 1  
(pointing at Garth)  
Garth’s bus drivers are still on the picket line—and without them no one’s going anywhere.

CLAUDE  
Oh for Jaysus sake, I'll tell them where to go.  
(to JANICE)  
Don’t quote me on that.

STAFF 2  
(covering the phone)  
I've got the SPCA lady on the line again asking about animals —

CLAUDE  
Tell Bonnie we've got people to deal with.

STAFF 4  
Claude! Apparently those five planes that aren’t responding? They’re treating them as bomb threats!

EVERYONE begins to panic.

STAFF 8 ^  
Why are we getting the bomb threats?

STAFF 12 ^  
Oh no. Donny’s down there. He just headed down there!

STAFF 5 ^  
Bomb threats! What do they mean Bomb threats?

STAFF 9 ^  
My kids are watching those planes.

STAFF 7 ^  
Why were they even sent here? Why not Toronto?!

STAFF 1 ^  
How many are we getting?

STAFF 10 ^  
Half the town’s gone down to watch!

STAFF 2 ^  
What are we supposed to do?

STAFF 4 ^  
They don’t know what's on them!

STAFF 6 ^  
Do we evacuate the town? What do we do? Who’s on them?!

CLAUDE puts his fingers to his lips and whistles.

CLAUDE  
Alright! The RCMP is gonna handle it. But we’ve got almost seven thousand people who might be spending the night. Jaysus, that’s near as many as we got living here in town. We need to house them somewhere and we need to get them there —

GARTH  
Don't look at me!

CLAUDE  
Not to mention food and supplies and anything else that snarls up.

STAFF 12  
Well, why are they sending them here? Why not Toronto or Ottawa?

CLAUDE looks at them all.

CLAUDE  
Because if anything goes wrong, we have a lot less people to lose.

A slight pause as they all take that in.

Alright, Janice Mosher. Here’s your news. Gander Town Council declares a state of emergency.

# Song 4: Blankets and Bedding

JANICE  
11:53 am.

JANICE

BEULAH  
~Crystal, I saw on the news  
~That they’re looking for

CRYSTAL (ACTOR 1)  
~Do you know what they need

MARTHA (ACTOR 5)  
~I need something to do

MARTHA, CRYSTAL & BEULAH  
~'Cause I can’t watch the news anymore

ANNETTE (ACTOR 6)  
~Can I help?

ALL WOMEN  
~If a stranger ends up at your door

BEULAH  
You get on the horn  
(on the phone)  
Hello? This is Beulah Davis down at the Academy. I heard we might be getting some guests and I thought I'd see if I could help whosever in charge of getting the school organized. How many passengers can we take? Uh— well, we fit about 400 students — yes, we could probably do 600. Or sure, 700, if we really pack them in. When are they coming? Could be any time now? Well, I’m glad I phoned!

OZ  
I get a call from Beulah looking for “anything 700 people from around the world might need.” So, I go down to Shoppers and the manager says to just take what I want off the shelves — toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash, deodorant. And I'm back at the school, when Beulah says...

BEULAH  
You know, those planes probably got some babies on ‘em...

A slight pause.

OZ  
So, I'm back to Shoppers for diapers. And we're unpacking them, when Annette says...

ANNETTE  
You know, those babies are probably going to be hungry...

A slight pause.

OZ  
So, I’m back to Shoppers for formula and baby food. And when I get back, Beulah says...

BEULAH  
You know, those planes are probably filled with women of child bearing age...

Another pause.

OZ  
Sooo?

BEULAH  
So, I’m back to Shoppers to pick up as many pads and tampons as they have.

OZ exits, wincing.

JANICE  
The Baptist Church needs a hand moving their pews... Doctor O’Brien down at the pharmacy is ready to fill any prescriptions. Oh, and the Lion’s Club is looking for some toilet paper, if you have any extra.

The WOMEN begin packing and stacking boxes.

ANNETTE

MARGIE  
~Everyone's phoning

ANNETTE & BEULAH  
~We’re setting up rooms in the schools

MARGIE  
~Been crying all afternoon wondering  
~What can be done

The MEN enter carrying boxes across the stage.

MEN  
~What do we need?

ANNETTE  
I made a tray of sandwiches

BEULAH  
We need 50 more.

ANNETTE  
Sandwiches?

BEULAH

~What do we need?

DWIGHT  
200 gym mats! Is that enough?

BEULAH  
You tell me and we'll both know.

For the love of God, stop bringing toilet paper to the Lion’s Club!

# Song 5: 28 Hours/Wherever We Are

On the plane, the PASSENGERS look out the window.

PASSENGER 1  
When you include the original flight, we were on the plane probably 12, 13 hours.

PASSENGER 8 (KEVIN T)  
We were on there 15 hours.

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
(correcting him)  
20 hours.

PASSENGER 10  
28 hours. We were on the plane for over an entire day.

ALL  
~28 hours  
~Over an entire day  
~There was one aisle in the middle  
~Everyone knew every inch of that plane

PASSENGER 11  
We were allowed out of our seats, but not off the plane.

ALL  
~28 hours

PASSENGER 8 (KEVIN T)  
You never think about it, but airplane doors are twenty feet in the air.

ALL  
~Over an entire day

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
And even if you survived the jump, they probably would’ve shot you.

ALL  
~There was one aisle in the middle

PASSENGER 10  
Everyone knew every inch of that plane.

PASSENGER 3  
~That plane  
~Everyone knew every inch of

You could go up to first class. You could stretch in the aisles.

ALL  
~28 hours

PASSENGER 4  
Our flight was full—there were children sleeping on the floor.

ALL  
~Over an entire day

PASSENGER 7  
It had three seats on each side. There was only one aisle in the middle.

ALL  
~There was one aisle in the middle

PASSENGER 2  
We had no way to get information.

PASSENGER 12  
~That plane  
~Everyone knew every inch of

This was before most people had mobile phones —and only a couple people got through.

PASSENGER 8  
Hello?

PASSENGER 7  
Mom?

PASSENGER 5  
Bonjour.

PASSENGER 2  
Operator?

BEVERLEY is alone in the cockpit. She holds a phone to her ear.

BEVERLEY  
~Tom? Oh, thank God.  
~I finally got through.  
~I borrowed a passenger’s phone.  
~How are you? Are the kids okay?  
~No I’m fine, Tom. I'm fine.  
~Safe and sound on the ground here in Newfoundland.  
~We don’t know much—except for the BBC  
~Listen, I can’t talk long  
~Can you do something for me?

PASSENGER 8  
I'm okay.

PASSENGER 7  
I’m fine.

PASSENGER 5  
Oui. Bien.

PASSENGER 2  
Pick up.

BEVERLEY  
~Tell the kids I'm alright  
~Take them into the kitchen  
~And show them the map  
~That we used to put pins in  
~For each destination  
~That we flew together  
~Tell them I’m fine  
~Put a pin here in Gander

PASSENGER 12  
On our plane, someone has a cell phone.

PASSENGER 10  
But then the battery dies. There are phones in the backs of the seats.

PASSENGER 9  
But they don’t work.

PASSENGER 4  
Half the passengers on our plane don’t speak English.

PASSENGER 11  
Even if we knew what was happening, we don’t speak their language.

PASSENGER 10  
On our plane, we ask the flight attendants.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (ACTOR 3)  
But the captain says not to say too much. And that’s when rumors start flying.

PASSENGERS start sharing what they've heard. Some lines repeat through the planes, building to everyone speaking at the end.

FRONT PLANE  
PASSENGER 5  
There was an accident

MID PLANE  
PASSENGER 12  
An accident?

BACK PLANE  
PASSENGER 9  
The US airspace is closed

PASSENGER 8  
For the first time in history.

PASSENGER 9  
A helicopter crashed in Pennsylvania

PASSENGER 11  
Why won’t she tell us what's happening?

PASSENGER 5  
A helicopter crashed into a building.

PASSENGER 10  
A building?

PASSENGER 8  
The White House!

PASSENGER 7  
The White House was bombed.

PASSENGER 3  
I need you to calm down, ma’am!

PASSENGER 9  
We need to do something. Everyone calm down!

PASSENGER 10  
It's World War 3! Ohmygod, it’s World War 3!

PASSENGER 4  
Tell us what is going on!

In another area, JOEY jumps onto his chair unsteadily, holding up a mini-bottle of liquor. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT tries to get him down.

JOEY  
~Woooooo!  
~Meanwhile on our plane  
~We didn't have a clue  
~We were all going insane because

ALL  
~There wasn't squat to do

JOEY  
~Then the captain starts apologizing  
~Says on behalf of the airline, I'm giving each and everyone some

ALL  
~Complimentary booze!  
~Open the airplane doors  
~Wave at all the cars  
~Hello to whoever you are—  
~Wherever we are

PASSENGER 1  
The ground crews supplied whatever we needed.

PASSENGER 9 (KEVIN J)  
Nicotine patches.

PASSENGER 12 (NICK)  
Medication.

PASSENGER 5  
Pampers.

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, BOB & PARTY GIRLS  
Something to drink!

JOEY  
~So the flight attendants brought out all the mini bottles of liquor  
~And delivered them to everyone

ALL  
~Soon everyone got friendlier!

JOEY  
~I took a couple of pictures of the view there with my camera  
~We didn’t know where we were

ALL  
~But we knew that we were hammered!  
~Open the airplane doors! Wave at all the locals  
~Surely there's something better to do than park  
~Wherever we are

KEVIN T  
We'd been sitting there for 14 hours when we pull out the Grey Goose.

KEVIN J  
Kevin and I were kind of hiding it because, well...

KEVIN T  
Because we  
(indicating KEVIN J)  
didn’t want to share it. Anyway, this woman—this hot mess behind us kept completely freaking out.

DELORES is sitting behind them, completely freaking out.

DELORES  
I don’t understand why they can’t let us off. I mean, just to stretch our legs, I mean really? I need to get some air! Oh my god! I need to get off this plane!

KEVIN T  
And my boyfriend, Kevin— we're both named Kevin. It was cute for a while. Anyway, Kevin was not dealing with it well.

KEVIN J  
I'm going to kill her.

DELORES pushes the call button above her over and over.

DELORES  
Excuse me?! I would like to get off the plane. I am claustrophobic!

KEVIN J  
Excuse me! Would you like some Xanax? Because you are freaking out and it is freaking me out and we are all FREAKING THE FUCK OUT!!!

ALL  
~Open the airplane doors!  
~Let a little air in here  
~'Cause I could use a shower — or a bar (or a bar!)  
~Open the airplane doors!  
~Look at all the planes out there  
~There must be a convention, it’s bizarre  
~Wherever we are

GROUP 1 ^  
~28 hours  
~Out of the windows

GROUP 2 ^  
~28 hours  
~Nothing but darkness

GROUP 3 ^  
~28 hours  
~Darkness and headlights  
~28 hours  
~Nothing to see

BONNIE picks up her phone.

BONNIE  
Hello? It’s Bonnie Harris down at the Gander SPCA. I went down with the rest of the town to look at all those planes. Well, I got to wondering if there weren't any animals on them... No? There’s no animals on those planes? Not a one?! Okay, then. Thank you for your time.

She hangs up and dials another number.

Bonnie, are there animals on those planes?

DOUG  
Uh... Probably?

BONNIE  
“Probably.” Are they “probably” feeding them then? I’m heading over.

DOUG  
Bonnie, there’s armed guards, the army, police everywhere —

BONNIE  
Well, then they'll have to shoot me.

DOUG  
...Bonnie? Bonnie? Bonnie!

CLAUDE  
Look at it from my perspective. We've been coming to the table.

GARTH  
Will you look at it from MY perspective? We've been coming to the table too!

CLAUDE  
We've got the College, the churches and we've got the hotels for the crews. But we need your school busses. We've got no effing way to get them there...

GARTH  
Well, why don't you take them in your car?

CLAUDE  
Yeah, I can fit four in my Corolla, that's a great start.

UNION SUPPORTERS & TOWN STAFF  
Yeah, why don't you take them? Yeah, that's a great start.

GARTH  
That's a great start. Great.

CLAUDE  
Great. You think about it.

GARTH  
YOU think about it.

CLAUDE  
YOU think about it.

CLAUDE & GARTH  
Jaysus!

JANICE  
2:10pm. School bus drivers “thinking about” leaving the picket lines.

CLAUDE  
What's the point of an emergency if no one treats it like an effing emergency?... And you can quote me on that.

HANNAH  
The flight attendants keep telling us nothing’s wrong - but I’ve got kids and I’ve got grandkids —I know when someone's hiding something. And when parents need their kids to stop asking questions... They start playing movies.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
We ran through every movie we had: Legally Blonde, Doctor Dolittle 2, and... Titanic.

DELORES  
(totally drunk)  
~Near... far... wherever you —

ALL  
~Nothing to do, nothing to see  
~Thank God we stopped at the duty free  
~Wherever we are

NICK  
Do you mind if I sit here? I need to get some work done and there’s some drunk people at the back of the plane singing at the top of their lungs.

DIANE  
No... Of course. I’m Diane.

NICK  
Nick. How are you doing?

DIANE  
I’m worried about someone. He was flying today. I just wish there was some way to tell him where I am.

NICK  
Newfoundland —no, you know that— you just can’t tell him. Right. I’m hoping you're one of those people who laughs when English people say awkward things.

DIANE  
I just wish we knew what was happening.

ACTOR 2 (sotto)  
What's happening?

ACTOR 5 (sotto)  
What's happening?

SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN  
DIANE & NICK

DIANE  
~Your life

NICK  
~And your work

ALL  
~When the world may be falling apart

NICK & DIANE  
~And you think

DIANE  
~I’m alone

NICK  
~I'm alone

NICK & DIANE  
~And I'm so damn helpless

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY and the other DRUNK PASSENGERS stand together on their plane.

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, DRUNK PASSENGERS  
~There's nothing left to do but drink

Several PARTY GIRLS stand.

PARTY GIRLS (ACTORS 3 & 2)  
~We open the airplane doors  
~Flash all the cars  
~Wooo! I've never done that before

KEVIN T, KEVIN J, JOEY, DRUNK PASSENGERS  
~28 hours gone over an entire day  
~Running out of things to say  
~And wondering if there’s someone

ALL  
~Going to clue us in  
~Tell us all what’s happening  
~Because the sun is setting  
~And we're sitting in the dark  
~Wherever we are

BOB  
Later that night, I’m up in the cockpit with some of the other passengers when the pilot puts the radio on over the intercom—and the whole plane goes silent when the President gives his speech.

PRESIDENT BUSH (ACTOR 8)  
ask the American people to join me in saying a thanks for all the folks who have been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens and to join me in saying a prayer for the victims and their families. The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake: we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless.

BEVERLEY  
~You got through to the airline  
~Tom, I'm okay — tell me what's happening out there  
~How bad is it — tell me everything  
~Tom. Who was in the air?  
~No-no, I wouldn't have known them  
~No-no one on that airline  
Charles...  
Are you sure?

The music fades away.

BEVERLEY (acapella)  
~No,  
~I’m fine, Tom.  
~I'm fine.

.Scene 10

# Song 6: Darkness and Trees

BOB  
We can see them from the plane —this long line of headlights coming through the darkness.

GARTH  
Claude, can I have a word with you?

CLAUDE  
Garth, I don’t have time to go in circles with you anymore. I’ve got the army delivering a thousand less cots than we were —

GARTH  
Look. The union just voted. You’ve got your busses. Our complaint’s with our employer, not with the people on those planes.

CLAUDE  
Thank you.

GARTH  
But we’re back on the line the minute this is over.

CLAUDE  
Right.

THEY shake hands.

ALL  
~Off of the airplane

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
Ladies and gentlemen, you can take only your carry-on items. Checked luggage will remain in the hold.

ALL  
~Into the airport

PASSENGER 1 (DIANE)  
The captain and flight attendants tell everyone to take their blankets and pillows off the plane.

ALL  
~Out of the windows

KEVIN T  
We grab bottles of water too —

KEVIN J  
No one has any idea where they’re taking us.

ALL  
~Darkness and trees

BOB  
As we enter the airport, all those car lights are still aimed at us.

HANNAH  
We're scared. They’re probably scared too.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT  
The people here don’t know what to expect off of these planes.

KEVIN T  
The airport looks like something left over from the Cold War. Kevin is like...

KEVIN J  
Oh my god. We've gone back in time.

BOB  
The whole procedure — the soldiers and all the formality — it just makes me really nervous.

Inside the airport, two CUSTOMS OFFICERS process PASSENGERS.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS (ACTORS 4 & 7)  
Citizenship?

DIANE  
American.

NICK  
British.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Purpose of your trip?

DIANE  
Vacation.

NICK  
Conference.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Destination?

DIANE  
Houston.  
Texas.

NICK  
Thank you.

PASSENGERS 1 and 12 are waved on, replaced by PASSENGERS 3 and 9.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Citizenship?

PASSENGER 3  
American.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Egyptian.

The CUSTOMS OFFICER and a few OTHERS stop to look at ALI.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Purpose of your trip?

PASSENGER 3  
Family.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Business... just business.

CUSTOMS OFFICERS  
Destination?

PASSENGER 3  
LA.

ALI (ACTOR 9)  
Dallas — then Washington, D.C.

CUSTOMS OFFICER 4  
(to passenger 3)  
Thank you.

CUSTOMS OFFICER 7  
(to ALI)  
Could you come with me, sir?

BEVERLEY  
There’s a giant map on the wall of the airport and someone has written in red marker, “You are here.”

DIANE  
Excuse me. I need to find a phone.

HANNAH  
I need to call my son.

CUSTOMS OFFICER  
Phones are over there. But it's gonna be a while.

OZ  
They’re all lined up at the airport payphones —so eventually we put an “Out of Order” sign on them just so we can get people on the busses.

CLAUDE  
11:48 pm. Busses and drivers are now taking passengers to shelters, not just in Gander, but also to Gambo, Appleton, and farther communities of Lewisporte, Norris Arm, and Glenwood.

PASSENGER 12  
Our bus sits there forever.

PASSENGER 5  
While all the others leave. Finally, this other passenger gets on.

PASSENGER 4  
This guy from the Middle East.

PASSENGER 11  
Someone says he got questioned.

PASSENGER 2  
Someone says he got searched.

PASSENGER 1  
And now... he’s on our bus.

ALI slowly walks to the back of the bus as all the other passengers watch.

JANICE  
I try to interview the Red Cross, the Salvation Army ~ but they’ve got more important things to do than talk to me. That’s when I see them—the Plane People — through the bus windows. The terror on their faces. They have no idea where they’re going.

BEVERLEY  
They take me and my crew in a separate van and I'm looking out the window, trying to see where we are, but it is pitch dark. Now, I have flown over this area hundreds and hundreds of times. And it is just darkness — hardly any lights anywhere. And now here I am. Oh my god, this is just so remote.

GARTH enters and sits in front of a bus of passengers.

GARTH  
Every school bus we got is goin’ back and forth all night. Out at the Salvation Army Camp, we've delivered passengers from Germany, England, and France. And around three in the morning, my bus is designated to take all these African people out there.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Into the darkness

MUHUMUZA (ACTOR 10)  
My family and I try to see out the bus windows. No one tells us where we are going.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Onto a gravel road

GARTH  
Silence comes on the bus. We get outside of Gander and you could hear a pin drop.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~And all around us

MUHUMUZA  
My wife and daughter are scared. They ask me what is happening and I do not know.

ALL Except GARTH & MUHUMUZA  
~Darkness and trees

GARTH  
Behind me, this big man comes up to me and he says in this low voice...

MUHUMUZA  
Wewe watuchukuwa wapi?

GARTH  
What?

At the Academy, BEULAH and ANNETTE address everyone.

BEULAH  
Ladies and gentlemen, we need some help translating. If anyone speaks Mandarin, can you come to the library? And if anyone speaks Hindi, could you please come to the cafeteria? And if anyone speaks Newfoundlander, well lard tunder’n jaysus god bless ya, b’y.

ANNETTE  
We've got passengers from all over the world coming off these busses, all speaking different languages. We can’t even say “hello.”

BEULAH  
And if anyone knows — we think it’s...

ANNETTE  
Moldovan.

BEULAH  
Moldovan — that would also be helpful.

ANNETTE  
Other passengers help us translate. Mrs. Noonan, our French teacher, turns out to know a little Russian. And Mr. Michaels, our gym teacher, apparently he speaks Spanish.

# Song 6a: Mr. Michaels

MR. MICHAELS stands, holding a shaker and dressed as a fantasy Latin lover. He moves to Annette.

MR. MICHAELS (ACTOR 7)  
~Si, hablo. Español es la lengua del amor. No sólo soy un profesor de gimnasia, soy un profesor de pasión.

He exits with a flourish.

ANNETTE  
I'm sorry, what was I saying?
