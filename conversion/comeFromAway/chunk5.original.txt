Scene 27
KEVIN T
Everywhere you look, there are people from around the globe. Going back and forth
for phones — or showers. Grabbing something from Shoppers. I’m getting coffee at a
gas station on the main drag —and suddenly the entire place goes quiet...
#72 — Before Praye
EVERYONE on stage stands still. KEVIN turns around, looking.
And nobody moves. Even the people outside are standing still. And I look up at the
TVs and realize —it’s a national moment of silence in America. And all of these
Newfoundlanders— these people from another country — they maintain that moment
of silence. I don’t know if that would happen back home —at a busy gas station on
the main drag — but it happened here.
HANNAH
Beulah walks me to church—and when we get there, I light a candle for my son.
BEULAH
And I do too.
KEVIN T
I suddenly realized what that music was from my dream —it was an old hymn from
when I was a kid. Now, I haven’t been to church in years, but for some reason that
song was in my head.
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
“WHERE THERE IS HATRED, LET ME BRING YOUR LOVE,
WHERE THERE IS INJURY, YOUR PARDON, LORD,
AND WHERE THERE'S DOUBT TRUE FAITH IN YOU.
HANNAH KEVIN T
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE

There is a man here in town. He’s lived here nearly his entire life. He heard that
there was a Rabbi diverted here and he came to find me and tell me his story.
EDDIE (ACTOR 11)
I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents — they were Jews — they sent me here
before the war started —I still remember some prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was
told I should never tell anyone that I was Jewish—even my wife. But after what
happened on Tuesday —so many stories gone —just like that. I needed to tell someone.
ALI (ACTOR 9)
During El-Fagir, when most people are asleep it is easier to pray. But at El-Dhuhr, I
can feel them watching me. Sometimes I catch them when they think I’m not looking
—and I can see the fear in their eyes.
ANNETTE
Excuse me? Beulah wanted me to check on you. The library’s open —for anyone
looking for some peace —and a quiet place to pray.

Health Canada finally lets the animals off and quarantines them to Hangar One. It’s

then the chimps start imitating the dogs, and they're barking too. The phones are
ringing off the hook with people, who want to see their pets...
