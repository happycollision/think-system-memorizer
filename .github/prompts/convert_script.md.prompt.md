The files in the `${workspaceFolder}/src/routes/api/librettos/files/` folder have a special format. They are all scripts of plays, which denote character dialogue and action in specific ways. Additionally, you will note that some character/dialogue lines start with a >. This is to denote which character is the one we want to highlight. Can you look over the first 50 lines of a few of the files in the folder above, recognize the established patterns, then convert a script I will give you next into the proper format and add it to the folder?

Please note that the script that I give you will likely have some artifacts left over from the original formatting. If there are page numbers, or titles at the top of each page, or other artifacts, please remove them. Titles are fine the first time they occur, but after that, if they are repeated, they are likely just artifacts and should be removed.

In some cases, the script may have typos and misspellings that you may expect from an OCR process. You should ask me if the text was OCR'd, and if so, I will provide you with the original text. If the text is not OCR'd, then you should correct any typos or misspellings that you find.
