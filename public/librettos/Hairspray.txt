# Act 1
## Scene 1

> Corny: Hey there, Teenage Baltimore! Don't change the channel! 'Cause it's time for the Corny Collins Show! Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray! For hair that holds up even in a NASA wind tunnel!

Every afternoon  
When the clock strikes four  
A crazy bunch of kids  
Crash through that door  
  
They throw off their coats  
And leave the squares behind  
And then they shake it,  
Shake it, shake it  
Like they're losing their mind  
You'll never see them frown  
'Cause they're  
The nicest kids in town  
  
Every afternoon  
You turn your TV on  
  
And we know you  
Turn the sound up  
When your parents are gone  
  
And then you  
Twist and shout  
For your favorite star  
  
And once you've  
Practiced every step  
That's in your repertoire  
You better come on down  
And meet the  
Nicest kids in town  

...

Edna: Don't be silly, it ain't colored. The TVs black and white.

> Corny:  
Nice white kids  
Who like to lead the way  
And once a month  
We have our Negro day!  
And I'm the man  
Who keeps it spinning round  
Mr. Corny Collins  
With the latest, greatest  
Baltimore sound!  
  
So every afternoon  
Dropping every thing  
  
Who needs to read and write  
When you can dance and sing?  
  
Forget about your algebra  
And calculus  
You can always do your homework  
On the morning bus  
Can't tell a verb from a noun  
They're the nicest kids in town  

> Corny & Kids: Roll Call!

Edna: Turn that racket down. I'm trying to iron in here.

Girls: (scream) AHH 

> Corny:  
So, every night you're shaking  
As you lie in bed  
  
And the bass and drums  
Are pounding in your head  
Who cares about sleep  
When you can snooze in school?  
  
They'll never get to college  
But they sure look cool  
  
Don't need a cap and gown  
'Cause they're the  
Nicest kids in town  
  
They're the  
Nicest, nicest  
They're the  
Nicest, nicest  
They're the  
Sugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...  
Kids in Town!  

> Corny: Yeah! And that was our new dance of the week — the "Stricken Chicken." We'll be right back.

...

Velma: And you, Mr. Collins! None of that Detroit sound today. You have something against Connie Francis? 

> Corny: The kids are just over the moon for rhythm and blues, Velma. They can't get enough.

...

Velma: Ah, ah, ah! None of that! Save your personal lives for the camera! And we're back in five... four... three...

(the lights change to indicate we're back on the air) 

> Corny: Now don't forget, guys and Gidgets — our very first primetime spectacular is coming up on June 6th. We'll be live at Baltimore's brand-new Eventorium broadcasting nationwide! Talent scouts will be on hand from all of the major record labels, and sponsoring the event will be none other than our own ULTRA CLUTCH HAIRSPRAY. So, let's give a great big fawning Baltimore salute to the President of Ultra Clutch, Harriman F. Spritzer.

Spritzer: Ultra Clutch is happy to bring you fine youngsters to national attention.

All: Our big break! 

> Corny: Also, live on the special, we'll be crowning your choice for Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!

...

Amber: Hey, gang, don't forget to watch mom and me next Thursday on mother daughter day. And I want to be your Miss Teenage Hairspray. Remember, a vote for me from you is a vote for me. 

> Corny: What an unexpected ad lib, Amber. And it speaking of expecting the unexpected, our own a fun loving, freewheeling Brenda will be taking a little leave of absence from the show. How long will you be gone, Brenda?

Brenda: Nine months. 

> Corny: So, it seems we'll have an opening for a girl who is just as fun-loving, but maybe not quite as freewheeling. Wanna be one of the nicest kids in town? Cut school tomorrow and come down to station WZZT to audition!

## Scene 5 - The Madison

(Patterson Park High School gymnasium. Corny takes the mic.)

> Corny: Hey, there, sophomores and sophomores at heart. I'm honored to be your guest DJ here at PPHS. So with no further a do-do, let's do-do some dancing. (music starts) It's the hottest dance around and it was born right here in Baltimore. What's it called kids?

Students: The Madison! 

> Corny: And where'd you see it first?

Students: The Corny Collins Show! 

> Corny: Let's form to big strong lines — it's Madison time! Go!

...

Seaweed: You keep your eye on Corny. This could be your big chance. 

Tracy: You better keep an eye on me.

> Corny: Now when I say "Hit it," show me a big, bad Baltimore Box...... hit it!

Little Inez: How come we always have to dance in the back?

Seaweed: I don't know. There's them and there's us. That's just the way it is.

> Corny: When I say "hit it," take it to the basket like Wilt the Stilt......hit it! (to Amber) Amber, who's your friend? She's like a breath of fresh, mountain air.

Amber: You got the Mountain part right. Oink-oink. 

> Corny: Now when I say "hit it," let's take a drive down Druid Hill....hit it! Hang a right....feed the monkey.....he's in the back seat.

Link: Hey, little darlin'. Haven't we met somewhere? 

Tracy: Ohmigod, Link Larkin just spoke to me. I'll never wash this ear again.

> Corny: When I say "hit it," let's make like Jackie Gleason — hommina, hommina, hommina....hit it!

All: And away we go!

Tracy: Hi, Corny!

> Corny: Hey, cupcake. What's your name? 

Tracy: I'm Tracy Turnblad. 

> Corny: What else have you got hiding in those Buster Browns?

...

Amber: Everybody stop liking her!!!! 

> Corny: OK everybody, let's take it home. Crazy! (The kids do the Madison) And that, Baltimorians, is how we do the Madison.

## Scene 6 - Success
### Nicest Kids Reprise

Kids: Oh - oo - oo... Hoot hoot hoot hoo-oot

> Corny: Hey there teenage Baltimore. You're just in time for the Corny Collins Show!

Spritzer: Brought to you by Ultra Clutch! 

> Corny: And it tastes good too. Today's jam packed edition will feature Link Larkin singing a special request Top 40 hit "It Takes Two." So, let the party begin!

...

Tracy: And I'm Tracy!

Council Members: Whoo!

> Corny & Kids:  
So, every night you're shaking  
As you lie in bed  
  
And the bass and drums  
Are pounding in your head  

> Corny:  
Who cares about sleep  
When you can snooze in school?  
  
They'll never get to college  
But they sure look cool  
  
Don't need a cap and gown  
'Cause they're the  
Nicest kids in town  
  
They're the  
Nicest, nicest  
They're the  
Nicest, nicest  
They're the  
Sugar and spice-est, the Nicest Kids In...  
Kids in Town!  

> Corny: Yeah! And that was our dance of the week — "Peyton Place After Midnight," introduced to you by our brand-new Council member, Miss Tracy Turnblad.

...

Edna: She can't hear you. (the phone rings and she answers it.) Hello?... Yes. This is her childhood home. No I'm not her father. 

> Corny: So let's wave a wistful bye-bye to Brenda — see you next year.

Council Members: Awww...

> Corny: ...and inaugurate the newest member of our Council, Tracy Turnblad! Cozy up to old Corny and tell us about yourself, Trrrrace.

Tracy: Well, I go to Patterson Park High, I watch your show, and do absolutely nothing else. (all applaud and cheer) But someday I hope to be the first woman president of the world or a Rockette. You got to think big to be big!

> Corny: And if you were president, what would your first official act be?

Tracy: Well, I'd make every day Negro Day!

Velma & Spritzer: Aaaaaiiieeeeeee!!!!!!

> Corny: I read you like tomorrow's headlines, Trace! What do you say, kids? Looks like we might just have a hot new candidate for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

Amber: (grabbing the mic) no, she can't be miss hairspray! She's the before in the Metrecal diet ad, and I'm the after, and afters always win!

> Corny: Amber, what the comedian! (bonks Amber on the head) So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?

Amber: (grabbing the mic) No! He can't because everyone knows that whenever he sings, he sings to me, he's completely involved with me, see?

> Corny: Right. So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?

Tracy: Would I? Would I?

Amber: (grabbing the mic) You people are ignoring the laws of nature!

> Corny: Link Larkin, our own budding Elvis, will now sing to the equally blooming Tracy Turnblad his version of this week's Top 40 hit, "It Takes Two."

...

Spritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, Negro Day everyday? That chubby communist girl and kissing on the mouth with possibly parted lips... I assure you, controversy is not what Ultra Clutch wishes to promote.

> Corny: Negroes and chubby girls buy hairspray, too, Mr. Spritzer.

Spritzer: Mrs. Von Tussle, how do you plan to handle this?

Velma: I plan to start by firing him!

> Corny: You can't fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collings Show.

Velma: Why not? They do it all the time on Lassie!

> Corny: Mr. Spritzer, to keep your audience, you got to keep up with the times.

Velma: This show's fine the way it is.

> Corny: Bringing Tracy on is just beginning. I've got terrific ideas for updating the show.

Spritzer: I'm getting one of my sick headaches. Is there a place where I might lie down?

Velma: There's a bed in my office. (Spritzer leaves) So you've got ideas, do you? And going behind my back to put this no talent Commie on the show is one of them?

> Corny: Damn right, Velma. It's time we put kids on the show who looks like the kids who watch the show.

Velma: Not while I'm producing it.

> Corny: I was thinking it might be time to change that, too.

Velma: Are you threatening me, Collins?

> Corny: Aw, you know me, Velma! On the other hand, I could always take the show to Channel 11. (Corny exits laughing)

# Act 2
# Scene 5 - Miss Teenage Hairspray

(Drum Roll... Corny appears on stage)

> Corny: And now, live, from the certified up-to-code Baltimore Eventorium... For the first time ever on nationwide television... it's The Corny Collins Spectacular...

Girls: He's Corny!

> Corny: Brought to you by Ultra Clutch Hairspray!  
  
What gives a girl  
Power and punch?  
Is it a charm, is it poise?  
No, it's hairspray!  
  
What gets a gal  
Asked out to lunch  
Is it brains, is it dough?  
No, it's hairspray  
  
If you take a ride  
With no can at to your side  
Then your flip will be gone with the wind  
  
But if you spray it and lock it,  
You can take off in a rocket  
And in outer space  
Each hair will be in place  
  
Why take a chance  
When you get up and dance?  
If you twist, I insist  
You use hairspray  
  
And tell your mother  
Her head she should smother  
With "Ultra-Clutch" faithfully  
  
So if you're a redhead, a blond or brunette  
Just take my advice  
And you might just get  
  
The only thing better than hairspray  
That's me!  
  
Forget the milk man  
The only thing better than hairspray  
That's me!

Ensemble: Ah Ah Ah Ah...

> Corny & Ensemble:  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
What makes a man  
Reach out and touch  
Ultra clutch!  
So if you're a redhead, a blonde or brunette  

> Corny:  
Just take my advice  
And you might just get  

The only thing better than hairspray  
That's me!  

Girls: He's Corny Collins!

> Corny:  
The only thing better than hairspray  
That's me  

Councilettes:  
Ska-doo-dl-e-ya-do-wah

> Corny & The Councilettes:  
Ska-doo-dl-e-doo-wah-do-wah

> Corny: "Hey baby, you look like you could use a stiff one!"

...

Velma: Get out! And coming back to Corny on camera one in 3...2...

> Corny: And now for the talent portion of the competition where the frontrunner gals present a dance of their own creation. (looking at the scoreboard) Presently, it appears Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad are neck and neck. But since, according to the latest police bulletins, Miss Turnblad is still at large...

Amber: At VERY large.

> Corny: ...our Miss Hairspray might just be a foregone conclusion. Still, our rules say contestants have to dance for it. Are you ready, Amber?

...

Amber: Thank you ladies, gentlemen and kids. I'm now ready to consume the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray.

(Corny leads Spritzer on. Spritzer carries the crown and bouquet.)

> Corny: Just to be sure, I think we'd better check the board.

Spritzer: Could we please see the tally?

(all turn to the board and amber wins by a few votes)

Yes, Amber Von Tussle just squeaks in as the winner.

Amber: What did I tell you? Give me the crown, give me the flowers, and everybody start bowing!

Tracy: Not so fast, Amber. Look who's coming in the front door.

> Corny: Right on schedule! I mean, I know nothing about this complex plan. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the never to be counted out Tracy Turnblad.

...

Ensemble: So come on! Come on! Come on!

> All:  
Ever since we first saw the light  
...  
Cause you can't stop the  
Motion of the ocean or the rain from above  
...  
You can't stop the beat (x3)  

### after: You can't stop the beat

(applause)

> Corny: Everyone, look... Look at the scoreboard! (all look) Tracy Turnblad, I declare you Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!

...

Tracy: Of course you, Link. But I also want a graduate degree in Musicology with a minor in the ethnic studies. And if there's something else I'd like to say - The Corny Collins Show is now and forever more officially integrated! (Cheers fill the room)

> Corny: America look up! Here's history right before your eyes. Television will never be the same.

...

Prudy: And you look so happy. I can't say it's what I want, but if this fine looking cat-like black boy is responsible for the light in your eyes, then how could I object?

> Corny: Live television - there's nothing like it.

Edna:  
...  
Well, I just don't give a damn!  
Cause the world---  

Backups:  
Keeps spinning round and round  
Keeping time to the speed of sound  
Til I heard the drums and I found my way  

> All:  
Cause you can't stop the beat  
Ever since this whole world began  
...  
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean  
Or the sun in the sky  
...  

Backups:  
Til I heard the drums and I found my way  

> All:  
Ever since we first saw the light  
...  
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean  
Or the rain from above  
...  
  
Ahhh  
  
Come on you Von Tussles...  

Backups:    
Hoot Hoot...  
  
> All:  
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean  
Or the rain from above  
...  

# Bows

> All:  
We promise Baltimore  
That someday when you take to the floor  
Your world will be full of romance  
Come on give it a chance  
Come on loosen your pants  
  
Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round  
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of sound  
I was lost til I heard the drums then I found my way  
  
Cause you can't stop  
The motion of the ocean or the rain from above  
You can try to stop the paradise... etc
