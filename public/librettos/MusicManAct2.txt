# Act 2
##  scene 2


Mayor Shinn: Well ya can't. I've read that book you gave me from cover to cover for a whole week not and didn't find a thing!

HH: Mr. Mayor, if you please —

Mayor Shinn: I'll settle your hash as soon as I get these premises offa' my oldest girl — yes.

HH: All right but meantime I want you to know I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas. That boy's got the confidence of every kid in town — you'll be standing in line waiting to shake his hand by time our Band plays its first concert.


Marian: Professor Hill, I think Mayor Shinn has behaved abominably and I think it was wonderful of you coming to Tommy's defense.

HH: Oh, that was nothing.

Marian: Yes it was.

HH: Oh, no. A man can't doge the issue every time a little personal risk is involved — (Watching her) What does the poet say? The coward dies a thousand deaths — the brave only 500 — (laughs gaily suddenly ties serious) Unfortunately, of course, the Mayor was already pretty mad on account of his Billiard Parlor. Now — (Shrugs ruefully) Oh I suppose a recommendation from a musical authority like yourself would help but — (leaving) I couldn't think of asking you to do a thing like that.

Marian: Why, Professor Hill.

HH: You would?

Marian: I'd be glad to. I just wish I was a little more informed — I'be been wanting to talk to you about Winthrop's Cornet.

HH: His Cornet? Mother-of-pearl keys.

Marian: I'm sure it's fine. [...] he made a few — ah — experimental — blats? I guess you'd say?

H: Yes — yes, blats.

Marian: And he sings the "Minuet in G de da" almost constantly.

HH: La de da de da de da de da. La de da. La de da —

Marian: But he never touches the  Cornet.

HH: Well, you see —

Marian: He says you told him it wasn't necessary.

HH: Well.

Marian: He tells me about some "Think System." If he thinks the "Minuet in G", he won't have to bother with the notes. Now, Professor —

HH: Miss Marian. The Think System is a revolutionary method, I'll admit. So was Gallileo's conception of the Heavens, Columbus' conception of the egg — ah — globe. Bach's conception of the Well-Tempered CLavicord. Hmm? Now I cannot discuss these things here in public. But if you'll allow me to call — (Spotting the ladies who are entering hastily) When may I call?


# Scene 2

Ewart: Sorry, Professor, but we got our orders.

Oliver: We all been deputized.

HH: Yes — congratulations. Let's see now — you know all week I've tried to get you fellow my references and credentials, but every time you seem to get off the subject somehow. Now I have just what you want up in my hotel room — take me a second.

Ewart: Sorry. 'Fraid I'll have to go along with you.

HH: Yes — well, let's see if I have my key — (Finds paper in pocket) What's this? — Oh — a testimonial from Madame Rini, the only female bassoon player ever to appear on the Redpath Circuit. Her stage name, of course. Actually she was from Moline. Lida Rose Quackenbush.

Ewart: Could I see that for a minute?

HH: (Hastily pocketing it) Oh, you'll never forget the name. Lida Rose. Same as the old song. (Gets out pitch pipe and blows it) LIDA ROSE I'M HOME AGAIN, ROSE,

## Scene 3


Mrs. Paroo: Marian... Marian! Marian dear! Who was you talkin' to just — Why Professor Hill!

HH: Mrs. Paroo! The top a' the evening! Miss Marian.


Mrs. Paroo: Well, I'll put some on.

HH: Shall we "set" as your mother said?

Marian: Well, I...

HH: You did ask me to call...?

Marian: Did I?... I didn't mean anything...

HH: Now Miss Marian, I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but Academic enlightenment. (Marian looks at him quizzically) The Think System? I've been by your house to try to explain it to you a time of two this week but there always seemed to be people around — mostly ladies I thought.

Marian: Yes, Mrs. Squires and several of the ladies.

HH: I''m glad — wouldn't want anybody beating my time. (Laughs) You wouldn't? No ma'am... Well... it's evidently not the convenient night. See you at the Sociable later. (Starts to leave)

Marian: Professor Hill... Is it true that you've — had a hundred... what I'm trying to say is...

HH: Yes?

Marian: Is it really true that you've developed a... a Think System?

HH: A what? A Think System? Oh — Think System — yes. It's really very simple. As simple as whistling. Nobody has to show you how to use your lips in whistling. You only have to think a tune to have it come out clearly here. (Pointing to her lips) Now just try this yourself, before you ask any questions. (Puckers up)

Marian: I take your word.

HH: Could we sit down?

Marian: Are all music teachers as dense as I am?

HH: All music teachers?

Marian: I daresay you meet dozens — even a hundred —

HH: Well I —

Marian: Have they all been fascinated as I have with... the Think System?

HH: Some more, some less. One young lady had thought up the same system before I got to her town. She showed me a few refinements...

Marian: I see...

HH: Have I sad something wrong?

Marian: Please don't let me keep you, Professor Hill. You must have many more important things to do than to explain the Think System to me.

HH: Can't think of one.

Marian: And I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.

HH: Now saaaay... where'd you get an idea like that?

Marian: One hears rumors of traveling salesmen.

HH: Now, Miss Marian — you mustn't believe everything you hear. After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.

Marian: I suppose you're referring to Uncle Maddy?

H: Uncle Maddy?

Marian: Mr. Madison — my father's best friend. No matter what they say he left me an assured job so Mother and Winthrop and I would have some security. Surely you don't believe...

HH: Of course not! That's exactly what I'm saying. But why do you think people start those rumors?

Marian: Narrow-mindedness, jealousy — jealousy mostly, I guess.

HH: Exactly. And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen. (Catching her off guard. Quietly) What have you heard?

Marian: Oh — oh nothing about you personally — just generally —

HH: What have you heard generally?

Marian: Just that — (Harold is very close to her) but of course [...] I mean, now honestly — mightn't they?

HH: Why?

Marian: (Racing on) And, so you say — if another salesman — or somebody were jealous — I mean — well, they could be downright lies — couldn't they?

HH: (Confused) What could?

Marian: Rumors and things.

HH: Why of course.

Marian: It just proves you should never believe everything you hear, doesn't it? I mean if you discuss things...

HH: Miss Marian, I would be delighted to discuss anything in the world with you. But couldn't we do it sitting down? (Trying to lighten her mood) You do sit?... Your knees bend and all.

Marian: We could sit on the porch steps.

HH: We could also sit on a large hollow log over't the footbridge.

Marian: I couldn't think of it. I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.

HH: Just to talk.

Marian: I've got to dress for the Sociable.

HH: Then meet me there in fifteen minutes.

Marian: I just can't — please — some other time — maybe tomorrow.

HH: My dear little librarian —Pile up enough tomorrows and you'll find you've collected nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you but I'd like to make today worth remembering.

Marian: Oh — so would I.

HH: The footbridge — fifteen minutes.

## Scene 4 the Footbridge

Marcellus: Psst! Hey Greg! [...] The people are going to be screaming for music of those kids show up at the Sociable.

HH: Yeah —

Marcellus: Here's most a' the dough. [...] Pretending to hold a practice over't the lumber yard.

HH: All right, Marce. Get the rig.

Marcellus: I got it!

HH: What time's the freight go?

Marcellus: Nine-forty from the junction.

HH: Well it's not even eight-thirty yet —

Marcellus: Look, you wanta turtle-wurtle around here and get yourself caught in a bunny-trap, you go ahead, but —

HH: Don't worry, Marce. I'll meet you at the Hotel in plenty a' time. (Marce exits as Marian enters) Miss Marian! (They rush toward each other and meet on the bridge) You're late.

Marian: But you said fifteen minutes —

HH: I meant that you were about — Well I'd say — about twenty-six years late — took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.

Marian: If you want to know the truth it was almost longer.

HH: Oh?

Marian: Halfway here I nearly turned back. I suppose I'm not the first to find it easier to think clearly when not under the spell of your salesmanship.

HH: Now Miss Marian — surely you don't think I've been selling you anything.

Marian: No — you've given me something. That's why I deceived to come.

HH: (Bewildered) I don't recall giving —

Marian: Oh yes, you have! [...] But that's no reason for me not to be grateful for what you will have left behind for me!

HH: (Beginning to protest) Marian — I —

### Till there was you

HH: Marian, there's a lot of things you don't know about me —
