## Scene 1

Charlie: ... Even the great professor Harold Hill wouldn't try to sell them neck bowed Hawkeyes out here.

Conductor: Boart!

>Harold: Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I'll have to give Iowa a try


## Scene 2

### After Iowa Stubborn

>Harold: Ah, Mr. Squires? Yes, I'm interested in a rig for Sunday, if you could accommodate me.


Marcellus: Hey, Gregory!

>Harold: Marcellus!

Marcellus: You old son of a gun! What in --

>Harold: Sh — sh — shhh.

Marcellus: But Greg—

>Harold: Professor Hill's the name — Harold Hill.

Marcellus: But Greg, what are you doing here? Whyn't you let me know you was comin'?

>Harold: I didn't know I was myself. Besides how could I know you'd end up in a little tank town like this? You were a pretty big slicker when you were in business with me.

Marcellus: Too many close shaves the way you work. Besides I got me a nice comfortable girl — Ethel Toffelmier — boss's niece.

>Harold: Gone legitimate huh? I knew you'd come to no good.

Marcellus: What's the new pitch?

>Harold: (Pantomimes conducting)

Marcellus: You're not back in the band business! I heard you was in steam automobiles.

>Harold: I was.

Marcellus: What happened?

>Harold: Somebody actually invented one.

Marcellus: No!

>Harold: Now give me the lowdown here, Marce.

Marcellus: You'll never get anywhere [...] music teacher who'll expose you before you get your grip unpacked.

>Harold: Male or female?

Marcellus: The music teacher? She's the librarian — female.

>Harold: Perfect! That's what I wanted to hear. If she passes by point her out to me.

Marcellus: I will. How are you gonna start the pitch?

>Harold: Same old way. Keep that music teacher off balance — and then my next step will be to get your town out of the serious trouble it's in.

Marcellus: River City isn't in any trouble.

>Harold: Then I'll have to create some. I have to create a desperate need for a Boys' Band. You remember — Now what's new around here. What can I use?

Marcellus: Nothin' — except the Bullard parlor's just put in a new pool table.

>Harold: They never had a pool table here before?

Marcellus: No — only billiards.

>Harold: That'll do. (Puts down his suitcase) See you later, Marce — and don't forget — music teacher. (Pantomimes piano playing)

Marcellus: Music teacher.

>Harold: Ah — you're Mr. Dunlop.

Ewart: Yep.

>Harold: Either you are closing your eyes to a situation you do not wish to acknowledge or you are unaware of the caliber of disaster indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.

### During Trouble

>Harold: Mothers of River City! Heed the warning before it's too late! Watch for the tell-tale signs of corruption! The moment your son leaves the house does he rebuckle his knickerbockers below the knee? Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger? A dime novel hidden in the corn crib? Is he memorizing jokes out of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang? Are certain words creeping into his conversation? Words like "swell" and "so's your old man"? If so my friends —

## Scene 3 (right after Trouble)

>Harold: Did you drop your —

Marian: No!

>Harold: Didn't I meet you in —

Marian: No!

>Harold: I will only be in town a short while —

## Scene 5: Gymnasium

Mayor Shinn: Will you members of the school board stop bickerin' in public?

Olin: All in the world I said was —

Mayor Shinn: Never mind! Four score —

>Harold: We heard there's a pool table in town.


Man 2: We don't want any more exercises till we get this pool table matter settled!

>Harold: Let's protect our children. (Crowd reacts) Resist sin and corruption. (Crowd reacts) Smite that devil and keep our young boys pure. (Appearing at the podium) Friends...

### during Trouble Reprise

>Harold: And that band's gonna be in uniform! Johnny, Willy, Teddy, Fred! And you'll see the glitter of crashing Cymbals. And you'll hear the thunder of rolling Drums; the shimmer of trumpets — Tantara! And you'll feel something akin to the electric thrill I once enjoyed when Gilmore, (Slam) Liberatti, (Slam) Pat Conway, (Slam) The Great Creatore, (Slam) W.C. Handy, (Slam) and John Philip Sousa all came to town on the very same historic day.


Mayor Shinn: (exiting) Men, I want that spellbinder' credentials.

>Harold: Constable, I'll be responsible for the boy.

Const: You don't know this kid — he's tough, and he's got his gang waitin' outside.

>Harold: Oh, I'll be careful. Tommy, like to talk to you about the band.

Tommy: Aw gee, Professor, that's for the little kids.

>Harold: I'm not talking about you playing in the band. You're mechanically minded, aren't you? Ever do anything with perpetual motion?

Tommy: Nearly had it a couple times.

>Harold: You did? You're my man! Do you realize that nobody has ever invented a music-holder for a marchin piccolo player? (Holds arms in playing position) No place to hang the music.

Tommy: Jeely Kly! Wonder where I could get some wire from.

>Harold: Look in your cellar, that's where people keep wire. (Tommy starts tearing out. The constable makes a move, Harold restrains him.) Oh, Tommy!

Tommy: Yessir?

>Harold: Now Constable, I'll show you how to break up a gang. Oh young lady. Oh miss — what's your name?

Zaneeta: Zaneeta. I didn't have any idea you was beckoning to me. Ye Gods.

>Harold: Do you know Tommy Djilas?

Zaneeta: Well, I —

>Harold: Tommy, this is Zaneeta. Escort the young lady home.

Zaneeta: Only excepting I'm not going home. I have to go to the Liberry. Ye Gods.

>Harold: Then escort the young lady home by way of the library — (Takes out coins) by way of the candy kitchen.

Tommy: Yes sir. Do I hafta?

>Harold: You hafta.

Tommy: Yes sir.

Zaneeta: Ye Gods.

Const: Professor, you're a bright young fellow. You made a couple mistakes, though.

>Harold: Oh?

Const: The Mayor happens to own the Billiard Parlor and that new pool table.

>Harold: Oh. What was my other mistake?

Const: That Zaneeta. She's the Mayor's oldest girl.


Jacey: Make him put up a bond!

>Harold: What am I hearing? (Pitch pipe) Say — ICE CREEEEEEM

Olin: Ice Cream, but I don't sing young man, if that's what you're —

>Harold: All right, talk then. (Low) Down here!

Olin: Ice Cream.

>Harold: Talk slow!

Olin: ICE CREEEEEM

>Harold: See? Singing is only sustained talking. NOW YOUUUU.

Oliver: ICE CREEEEM.

>Harold: NOW YOUUUU. RIGHT HEEEER.

Ewart: ICE CREEEEEM.

>Harold: (Points skyward to Jacey) Now you, sir!

Jacey: ICE CREEEEEEEEEMMMMMM.

>Harold: Ladies, from now on you'll never see one of those men without the other three.

Eulalie: Oh, Professor, you're wrong! Why they've hated each other for fifteen years.

Men: ICE CREAM. ICE CREAM. ICE CREAM.

>Harold: (pointing at quartet) HOW CAN THERE BE —

## Top of Scene 6

>Harold: I don't suppose you live alone, or anything?

Marian: No!

>Harold: I've got some wonderful caramels over't the hotel if you'd —

Marian: Mister Hill.

>Harold: Professor Hill.

Marian: Professor of what? At what college do they give a degree for annoying women on the street like a Saturday night rowdy at a public dance hall?

>Harold: Oh I wouldn't know about that. I'm a conservatory man myself. Gary, Indiana Gold medal Class of '05.

Marian: [...] which may very well give me some interesting information about you.

Marcellus: Hey, Gregory!

>Harold: Oh hi, Marcellus. And don't valley me Greg.

Marcellus: How'd you make out with the music teacher?

>Harold: Scrumptious. Ate out of my hand the minute I tipped my hat.

Marcellus: She did! [...] Just like when you used to imitate that band-concert fellow back in Joplin.

>Harold: Yeah! (Pantomimes conducting) Aw, kid stuff. I'm in rare form these days, son. Just you keep your eyes on me for the next four weeks.

Marcellus: Four weeks! It only used to take ten days for the instruments to arrive.

>Harold: It still does. But it takes four weeks for the uniforms.

Marcellus: Oh no, Greg! You haven't added uniforms!!???

>Harold: Uniforms and instruction books.

Marcellus: Instruction books! But you can't pass yourself off as a music professor — I mean not for any four weeks.

>Harold: (Ruefully) Marce —

Marcellus: But you don't know one note from another.

>Harold: I have a revolutionary new method called the Think System where you don't bother with notes.

Marcellus: But in four weeks the people will want to hear the music! You'll have to lead a band.

>Harold: When the uniforms arrive they forget everything else — at least long enough for me to collect and leave. Oh this is a refined operation, son, and I've got it timed right down to the last wave of the brakeman' hands on the last train out'a town. And now, Mr. Washburn, if you'll excuse me —

Marcellus: Gonna line yourself up a little canoodlin' huh? Say, I could fix you up with Ethel's sister — lovely girl — teaches Sunday school —

>Harold: No wide-eyed, eager wholesome innocent Sunday School teacher for me. That kinda girl spins webs no spider ever — listen boy —

### The Sadder But Wiser Girl


Eulalie: Oh, I couldn't say. I could not say. Oh no. I could not say, at this time. My husband will wish to investigate, I'm sure. And naturally I'm reticent. Oh yes, I'm reticent.

>Harold: Of course, Mrs. Shinn, I understand. But you see, part of my music plans include a committee on the dance and — no wait — wait! Do that again, Mrs. Shinn! Your foot! The way you raised it, just now!

Eulalie: Oh. Well I have a bunion there that bothers —

>Harold: Ohhh what grace! What natural flow of rhythm! What expression of line and movement!

Eulalie: Mr. Hill.

>Harold: You must accept the chairmanship of the Ladies Auxiliary for the Classic dance, mustn't she, ladies?

Women: Oh yes! Please! You must Eulalie.

>Harold: Every move you make, Mrs. Shinn, bespeaks Del Sarte. Will you — will you? Say yes, Mrs. Shinn!

Eulalie: Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn — ah — well! I — ah — that is — Dancing! Well!

>Harold: Then you accept?

Eulalie: Yes indeed! And I would like to say —

>Harold: Thank you. Now the young lady who plays the piano — Marian Paroo, I believe? (Ladies gasp) After all, she is the librarian.

### Pick a Little


Maud: [...] she advocates dirty books.

>Harold: Dirty books!


Eulalie: [...] who never had a friend in town till she came — old Miser Madison.

>Harold: (Puzzled) Miser Madison. Madison Gymnasium, Madison Picknic Park, Madison Hospital — that Miser Madison?

Maud: Exactly. Who'd he think he was anyway?

>Harold: Well I should say. Show off. Gave the town the library too, didn't he?


Jacey: Just a minute here! We need your credentials.

>Harold: Yes, of course. I have just what you want over at the Hotel. Come with me. (As Quartet starts to follow, to Ladies:) Goodnight ladies. (To Quartet:) GOODNIGHT LADIES.


## Scene 7: Song 18: Marian the Librarian

>Harold: It's all right — I know everything and it doesn't make any difference.

Marian: What are you talking about?

>Harold: You were probably very young — any one can make a mistake —

Marian: What —

>Harold: No apologies — no explanations, please. I'll only be in town a short time and — (Chuckles) — the sadder, but wiser girl for me.

Marian: Will you please make your selection and leave.

>Harold: I have.

Marian: Well? What do you want to take out?

>Harold: (Loudly) The librarian.

Marian: Quiet please.

>Harold: (Whispering) The librarian. You're not listening, Marian. (Takes a paper bag out of pocket) Look! (Sings) MAAAAAARIAN. (Speaks) Marbles. Six Steele's, eight aggies, a dozen peewees and one big glassine with an American flag in the middle. I think I'll drop 'em.

Marian: No!

>Harold: Shh! (Sings) MADAM LIBRARIAN [...]

### Near end of librarian song

>Harold: The Ladies' Dance Committee meets Tuesday nights. Marshmallow? (Sings) MADAM LIBRARIAN.

## Scene 8

>Harold: Well Tommy we've had a pretty good morning. Eleven sales out of twelve tries. Tell you what — It's almost noon. You better go home and get some dinner. I'll try a couple by myself.

Tommy: G'bye, Professor.

>Harold: Thanks, Tommy.

## Scene 9

Mayor Shinn: Just a minute here. Are you soliciting? You haven't got a license.

>Harold: Why no, Mayor Shinn, I collect doorbells. This particular specimen has an unusual tone quality that —

Mayor Shinn: Flattery will not avail you. Soliciting is statutory in this county — malfeasance without a permit. Why haven't you been down't City Hall with your references?

>Harold: Just missed you I — Mr. Mayor! Your hand — oh no!

Mayor Shinn: What, what —

>Harold: That spread of the little finger! It's hereditary!

Mayor Shinn: Oh it is — what does that mean?

It means that your son's little finger is perfectly situated to operate the spit valve on a B-flat Flugel Horn!

Mayor Shinn: Is that good?

>Harold: Good! It means that America has at last produced an artist who can flugel the minute waltz in 50 seconds.

Mayor Shinn: How could I get one of those horns?

>Harold: Sign here, Mr. Mayor. That'll be seventeen dollars import fee.

Mayor Shinn: Yes sir. Just think […] you be down’t city Hall with your By God papers at three o’clock.

>Harold: You mean this afternoon?

Mayor Shinn: I couldn’t make myself any plainer if I’se a Quaker on his day off.

### Scene 10

>Harold: Mrs. Paroo do you realize you have the facial characteristics of a Cornet virtuoso?

Mrs. Paroo: I don’t know if I understand you entirely, Professor.

>Harold: If your boy has that same firm chin, and those splendid cheek muscles — By George! Not that he could ever be really great, you understand, but —

Mrs. Paroo: Oh, is that so. And in the name of St. Bridget, why not?

>Harold: Well — you see all the really great Cornet players were Irish — O’Clark, O’Mendez, O’Klein —

Mrs. Paroo: But Professor, we are Irish!

>Harold: No! No! Really! That clinches it! Sign here, Mrs. Paroo. Your boy was born to play the Cornet! (She signs) Fine, fine. That will be seven dollars earnest money. Nothing more due until the first installment payable at opening of band practice. (She pays him) Ah thank you. And of course, I'll need the boy's measurements for his band uniform.

Mrs. Paroo: His uniform! (Winthrop falls off the porch in excitement)

>Harold: Hello, son. (Winthrop starts to run. Harold stops him) Certainly, his uniform. And there won't be a penny due till delivery, which gives him four weeks to enjoy, to anticipate, to imagine, at no cost whatever. Never allow the demands of tomorrow to interfere with the pleasures and excitement of today.

Winthrop: Would it have... a... a...?

>Harold: A stripe? Certainly, my boy, a wide red stripe on each side. What do you think of that?

Mrs. Paroo: You'll have to excuse him [...] Be-gob and be-jabbers! Where are you from, me bye?

>Harold: Gary, Indiana.

Mrs. Paroo: I knew it! Gar — . Where did you say?

>Harold: Gary, Indiana. In fact Gary Conservatory was my Alma Mater.

Mrs. Paroo: Was she now?

>Harold: (Aware of Marian's approach) Why yes — Gold Medal Class of '05. Hodado, Miss Paroo.

Marian: Hodado, Mr. Hill.

>Harold: Of course! Paroo. I thought the name sounded familiar. (Sotto) I've tried to see you since the other night, but —

Mrs. Paroo: He wants to put Winthrop in the band!

Marian: We're not interested, mama.

Mrs. Paroo: But Marian, the boy might have his father's musical gift. He does have my jaw, you know.

>Harold: Oh — your husband musical? Well I'd like to have a talk with him. I'm sure we —

Marian: Do you burst in on everyone's home like this? Prying into personal affairs? We're not interested.

Mrs. Paroo: Marian!

>Harold: Well, that's one for and one against. Now why not let the boy's father decide?

Marian: The boy's father is dead. Anything else?

>Harold: Oh, I'm sorry. But that's all the more reason why your brother should have something like this —

Marian: My brother is a ten year old [...] As to your musical tricks, why don't you go into business with a nice carnival man who sells gold painted watches and glass diamond rings?

>Harold: Musical tricks? Well, Miss Paroo, I hardly — (Without response Marian exits into house. Mrs. Paroo stands speechless. Harold stands approvingly, his finger alongside his nose) I get the feeling she likes the idea. Oh, a little cautious perhaps but I admire that in a woman. Just keep me alive and I'll be back later in the week.

Mrs. Paroo: One moment, Professor Hill. About the boy's measurements. I make all his clothes. Sleeve 21, Waist 18, Crouch 14, —

>Harold: Fine, that's all I need. Now I must get back to the Hotel.

Mrs. Paroo: Professor, I do hope you'll excuse Marian. She's not really —

>Harold: Please. Don't worry about a thing. I'm sure that at heart she's as lovely as yourself. Good day to ya, Widda Paroo.


## Scene 11


Winthrop: It'th the band inthtrumenth!

>Harold: Here you are, Winthrop.

Winthrop: My Cornet! Gee thankth, Profethor!

>Harold: Men! You will each receive individual instruction in due corse. In the meantimes stay off the streets — get acquainted with your instruments and think about the Minuet in G. La de da de da de da de da —


Mayor Shinn: About that book — (Marian hands him the book. Harold catches Marian's look, which is changing from gratitude to adoration)

>Harold: The Ladies's Dance Committee meets Tuesday nights at the High School.


# Act 2
##  scene 2


Mayor Shinn: Well ya can't. I've read that book you gave me from cover to cover for a whole week not and didn't find a thing!

>Harold: Mr. Mayor, if you please —

Mayor Shinn: I'll settle your hash as soon as I get these premises offa' my oldest girl — yes.

>Harold: All right but meantime I want you to know I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas. That boy's got the confidence of every kid in town — you'll be standing in line waiting to shake his hand by time our Band plays its first concert.


Marian: Professor Hill, I think Mayor Shinn has behaved abominably and I think it was wonderful of you coming to Tommy's defense.

>Harold: Oh, that was nothing.

Marian: Yes it was.

>Harold: Oh, no. A man can't doge the issue every time a little personal risk is involved — (Watching her) What does the poet say? The coward dies a thousand deaths — the brave only 500 — (laughs gaily suddenly ties serious) Unfortunately, of course, the Mayor was already pretty mad on account of his Billiard Parlor. Now — (Shrugs ruefully) Oh I suppose a recommendation from a musical authority like yourself would help but — (leaving) I couldn't think of asking you to do a thing like that.

Marian: Why, Professor Hill.

>Harold: You would?

Marian: I'd be glad to. I just wish I was a little more informed — I'be been wanting to talk to you about Winthrop's Cornet.

>Harold: His Cornet? Mother-of-pearl keys.

Marian: I'm sure it's fine. [...] he made a few — ah — experimental — blats? I guess you'd say?

H: Yes — yes, blats.

Marian: And he sings the "Minuet in G de da" almost constantly.

>Harold: La de da de da de da de da. La de da. La de da —

Marian: But he never touches the  Cornet.

>Harold: Well, you see —

Marian: He says you told him it wasn't necessary.

>Harold: Well.

Marian: He tells me about some "Think System." If he thinks the "Minuet in G", he won't have to bother with the notes. Now, Professor —

>Harold: Miss Marian. The Think System is a revolutionary method, I'll admit. So was Gallileo's conception of the Heavens, Columbus' conception of the egg — ah — globe. Bach's conception of the Well-Tempered CLavicord. Hmm? Now I cannot discuss these things here in public. But if you'll allow me to call — (Spotting the ladies who are entering hastily) When may I call?


# Scene 2

Ewart: Sorry, Professor, but we got our orders.

Oliver: We all been deputized.

>Harold: Yes — congratulations. Let's see now — you know all week I've tried to get you fellow my references and credentials, but every time you seem to get off the subject somehow. Now I have just what you want up in my hotel room — take me a second.

Ewart: Sorry. 'Fraid I'll have to go along with you.

Yes — well, let's see if I have my key — (Finds paper in pocket) What's this? — Oh — a testimonial from Madame Rini, the only female bassoon player ever to appear on the Redpath Circuit. Her stage name, of course. Actually she was from Moline. Lida Rose Quackenbush.

Ewart: Could I see that for a minute?

>Harold: (Hastily pocketing it) Oh, you'll never forget the name. Lida Rose. Same as the old song. (Gets out pitch pipe and blows it) LIDA ROSE I'M HOME AGAIN, ROSE,

## Scene 3


Mrs. Paroo: Marian... Marian! Marian dear! Who was you talkin' to just — Why Professor Hill!

>Harold: Mrs. Paroo! The top a' the evening! Miss Marian.


Mrs. Paroo: Well, I'll put some on.

>Harold: Shall we "set" as your mother said?

Marian: Well, I...

>Harold: You did ask me to call...?

Marian: Did I?... I didn't mean anything...

>Harold: Now Miss Marian, I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but Academic enlightenment. (Marian looks at him quizzically) The Think System? I've been by your house to try to explain it to you a time of two this week but there always seemed to be people around — mostly ladies I thought.

Marian: Yes, Mrs. Squires and several of the ladies.

>Harold: I''m glad — wouldn't want anybody beating my time. (Laughs) You wouldn't? No ma'am... Well... it's evidently not the convenient night. See you at the Sociable later. (Starts to leave)

Marian: Professor Hill... Is it true that you've — had a hundred... what I'm trying to say is...

>Harold: Yes?

Marian: Is it really true that you've developed a... a Think System?

>Harold: A what? A Think System? Oh — Think System — yes. It's really very simple. As simple as whistling. Nobody has to show you how to use your lips in whistling. You only have to think a tune to have it come out clearly here. (Pointing to her lips) Now just try this yourself, before you ask any questions. (Puckers up)

Marian: I take your word.

>Harold: Could we sit down?

Marian: Are all music teachers as dense as I am?

>Harold: All music teachers?

Marian: I daresay you meet dozens — even a hundred —

>Harold: Well I —

Marian: Have they all been fascinated as I have with... the Think System?

>Harold: Some more, some less. One young lady had thought up the same system before I got to her town. She showed me a few refinements...

Marian: I see...

>Harold: Have I sad something wrong?

Marian: Please don't let me keep you, Professor Hill. You must have many more important things to do than to explain the Think System to me.

>Harold: Can't think of one.

Marian: And I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.

>Harold: Now saaaay... where'd you get an idea like that?

Marian: One hears rumors of traveling salesmen.

>Harold: Now, Miss Marian — you mustn't believe everything you hear. After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.

Marian: I suppose you're referring to Uncle Maddy?

H: Uncle Maddy?

Marian: Mr. Madison — my father's best friend. No matter what they say he left me an assured job so Mother and Winthrop and I would have some security. Surely you don't believe...

>Harold: Of course not! That's exactly what I'm saying. But why do you think people start those rumors?

Marian: Narrow-mindedness, jealousy — jealousy mostly, I guess.

>Harold: Exactly. And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen. (Catching her off guard. Quietly) What have you heard?

Marian: Oh — oh nothing about you personally — just generally —

>Harold: What have you heard generally?

Marian: Just that — (Harold is very close to her) but of course [...] I mean, now honestly — mightn't they?

>Harold: Why?

Marian: (Racing on) And, so you say — if another salesman — or somebody were jealous — I mean — well, they could be downright lies — couldn't they?

>Harold: (Confused) What could?

Marian: Rumors and things.

>Harold: Why of course.

Marian: It just proves you should never believe everything you hear, doesn't it? I mean if you discuss things...

>Harold: Miss Marian, I would be delighted to discuss anything in the world with you. But couldn't we do it sitting down? (Trying to lighten her mood) You do sit?... Your knees bend and all.

Marian: We could sit on the porch steps.

>Harold: We could also sit on a large hollow log over't the footbridge.

Marian: I couldn't think of it. I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.

>Harold: Just to talk.

Marian: I've got to dress for the Sociable.

>Harold: Then meet me there in fifteen minutes.

Marian: I just can't — please — some other time — maybe tomorrow.

>Harold: My dear little librarian —Pile up enough tomorrows and you'll find you've collected nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you but I'd like to make today worth remembering.

Marian: Oh — so would I.

>Harold: The footbridge — fifteen minutes.

## Scene 4 the Footbridge

Marcellus: Psst! Hey Greg! [...] The people are going to be screaming for music of those kids show up at the Sociable.

>Harold: Yeah —

Marcellus: Here's most a' the dough. [...] Pretending to hold a practice over't the lumber yard.

>Harold: All right, Marce. Get the rig.

Marcellus: I got it!

>Harold: What time's the freight go?

Marcellus: Nine-forty from the junction.

>Harold: Well it's not even eight-thirty yet —

Marcellus: Look, you wanta turtle-wurtle around here and get yourself caught in a bunny-trap, you go ahead, but —

>Harold: Don't worry, Marce. I'll meet you at the Hotel in plenty a' time. (Marce exits as Marian enters) Miss Marian! (They rush toward each other and meet on the bridge) You're late.

Marian: But you said fifteen minutes —

>Harold: I meant that you were about — Well I'd say — about twenty-six years late — took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.

Marian: If you want to know the truth it was almost longer.

>Harold: Oh?

Marian: Halfway here I nearly turned back. I suppose I'm not the first to find it easier to think clearly when not under the spell of your salesmanship.

>Harold: Now Miss Marian — surely you don't think I've been selling you anything.

Marian: No — you've given me something. That's why I deceived to come.

>Harold: (Bewildered) I don't recall giving —

Marian: Oh yes, you have! [...] But that's no reason for me not to be grateful for what you will have left behind for me!

>Harold: (Beginning to protest) Marian — I —

### Till there was you

>Harold: Marian, there's a lot of things you don't know about me —

Marcellus: Psst! Hey Greg!

>Harold: Excuse me. I'm expecting a cable from Hector Berlioz — this could be it. (Hurries to meet Marcellus) Now what?

Marcellus: Who's the salesman here? Sounds like she's selling and you're buying.

>Harold: You nuts? I didn't know I'se goin' to be able to leave tonight — I had to keep her off balance, didn't I? I told you —

Marcellus: Well, she's so far off balance now you can't tell her from a cat boat in a hurricane.

>Harold: Listen Buster Brown, I've come up through the ranks on this skirmish — I'm not resigning without my commission.

Marcellus: But Greg, you can't get anywhere right out here on the footbridge —

>Harold: There's a place over't Madison Park near the Sociable makes this footbridge look like the old ladies home. Now beat it. Go get the rig. (Marcellus exist as Harold returns to Marian) Never a peaceful moment in the music business. (Preparing for the kill) Now then, where were we?

Marian: You were about to tell me what I don't know about you.

>Harold: (Trying to retract) Yeah — well we really don't have to go into that just now — do we —

Marian: No, we don't — or ever for that matter, Harold. The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately — but she did plenty when you first came here.

>Harold: (Slightly apprehensive) Oh — about what?

Marian: About Professor Harold Hill, Gary Conservatory of Music — Gold Medal Class of '05. Harold, there wasn't any Gary Conservatory in '05.

>Harold: Why there certainly —

Marian: Because the town wasn't even built till '06. (Kisses him) I'll see you at the Sociable.

>Harold: (Calling after her) You knew all the time?!

Marian: (Taking a paper from her bosom) Since July 7th — three days after you came. I tore this page out of the Indaiana Journal. (Handing him the paper) It was originally intended to use against you but now I give it to you with all my heart.

>Harold: But if you knew — why didn't you — (Marian throws him another kiss as she exits) Why you little —

## Scene 5
