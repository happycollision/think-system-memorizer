# Act 1
## Scene 3 (right after Trouble)

Harold: Did you drop your —

>Marian: No!

Harold: Didn't I meet you in —

>Marian: No!

Harold: I will only be in town a short while —

>Marian: Good!

## Top of Scene 6

Harold: I don't suppose you live alone, or anything?

>Marian: No!

Harold: I've got some wonderful caramels over't the hotel if you'd —

>Marian: Mister Hill.

Harold: Professor Hill.

>Marian: Professor of what? At what college do they give a degree for annoying women on the street like a Saturday night rowdy at a public dance hall?

Harold: Oh I wouldn't know about that. I'm a conservatory man myself. Gary, Indiana Gold medal Class of '05.

>Marian: [...] which may very well give me some interesting information about you.


## Scene 7: Song 18: Marian the Librarian

Harold: It's all right — I know everything and it doesn't make any difference.

>Marian: What are you talking about?

Harold: You were probably very young — any one can make a mistake —

>Marian: What —

Harold: No apologies — no explanations, please. I'll only be in town a short time and — (Chuckles) — the sadder, but wiser girl for me.

>Marian: Will you please make your selection and leave.

Harold: I have.

>Marian: Well? What do you want to take out?

Harold: (Loudly) The librarian.

>Marian: Quiet please.

Harold: (Whispering) The librarian. You're not listening, Marian. (Takes a paper bag out of pocket) Look! (Sings) MAAAAAARIAN. (Speaks) Marbles. Six Steele's, eight aggies, a dozen peewees and one big glassine with an American flag in the middle. I think I'll drop 'em.

>Marian: No!

## Scene 10

Harold: Gary, Indiana. In fact Gary Conservatory was my Alma Mater.

Mrs. Paroo: Was she now?

Harold: (Aware of Marian's approach) Why yes — Gold Medal Class of '05. Hodado, Miss Paroo.

>Marian: Hodado, Mr. Hill.

Harold: Of course! Paroo. I thought the name sounded familiar. (Sotto) I've tried to see you since the other night, but —

Mrs. Paroo: He wants to put Winthrop in the band!

>Marian: We're not interested, mama.

Mrs. Paroo: But Marian, the boy might have his father's musical gift. He does have my jaw, you know.

Harold: Oh — your husband musical? Well I'd like to have a talk with him. I'm sure we —

>Marian: Do you burst in on everyone's home like this? Prying into personal affairs? We're not interested.

Mrs. Paroo: Marian!

Harold: Well, that's one for and one against. Now why not let the boy's father decide?

>Marian: The boy's father is dead. Anything else?

Harold: Oh, I'm sorry. But that's all the more reason why your brother should have something like this —

>Marian: My brother is a ten year old [...] As to your musical tricks, why don't you go into business with a nice carnival man who sells gold painted watches and glass diamond rings?

# Act 2
##  scene 2

Harold: All right but meantime I want you to know I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas. That boy's got the confidence of every kid in town — you'll be standing in line waiting to shake his hand by time our Band plays its first concert.


>Marian: Professor Hill, I think Mayor Shinn has behaved abominably and I think it was wonderful of you coming to Tommy's defense.

Harold: Oh, that was nothing.

>Marian: Yes it was.

Harold: Oh, no. A man can't doge the issue every time a little personal risk is involved — (Watching her) What does the poet say? The coward dies a thousand deaths — the brave only 500 — (laughs gaily suddenly ties serious) Unfortunately, of course, the Mayor was already pretty mad on account of his Billiard Parlor. Now — (Shrugs ruefully) Oh I suppose a recommendation from a musical authority like yourself would help but — (leaving) I couldn't think of asking you to do a thing like that.

>Marian: Why, Professor Hill.

Harold: You would?

>Marian: I'd be glad to. I just wish I was a little more informed — I'be been wanting to talk to you about Winthrop's Cornet.

Harold: His Cornet? Mother-of-pearl keys.

>Marian: I'm sure it's fine. [...] he made a few — ah — experimental — blats? I guess you'd say?

H: Yes — yes, blats.

>Marian: And he sings the "Minuet in G de da" almost constantly.

Harold: La de da de da de da de da. La de da. La de da —

>Marian: But he never touches the  Cornet.

Harold: Well, you see —

>Marian: He says you told him it wasn't necessary.

Harold: Well.

>Marian: He tells me about some "Think System." If he thinks the "Minuet in G", he won't have to bother with the notes. Now, Professor —

Harold: Miss Marian. The Think System is a revolutionary method, I'll admit. So was Gallileo's conception of the Heavens, Columbus' conception of the egg — ah — globe. Bach's conception of the Well-Tempered CLavicord. Hmm? Now I cannot discuss these things here in public. But if you'll allow me to call — (Spotting the ladies who are entering hastily) When may I call?

>Marian: [...]


## Scene 3

>Marian: [missing lines]

Mrs. Paroo: Well, I'll put some on.

Harold: Shall we "set" as your mother said?

>Marian: Well, I...

Harold: You did ask me to call...?

>Marian: Did I?... I didn't mean anything...

Harold: Now Miss Marian, I'm not suggesting your invitation inferred anything but Academic enlightenment. (Marian looks at him quizzically) The Think System? I've been by your house to try to explain it to you a time of two this week but there always seemed to be people around — mostly ladies I thought.

>Marian: Yes, Mrs. Squires and several of the ladies.

Harold: I''m glad — wouldn't want anybody beating my time. (Laughs) You wouldn't? No ma'am... Well... it's evidently not the convenient night. See you at the Sociable later. (Starts to leave)

>Marian: Professor Hill... Is it true that you've — had a hundred... what I'm trying to say is...

Harold: Yes?

>Marian: Is it really true that you've developed a... a Think System?

Harold: A what? A Think System? Oh — Think System — yes. It's really very simple. As simple as whistling. Nobody has to show you how to use your lips in whistling. You only have to think a tune to have it come out clearly here. (Pointing to her lips) Now just try this yourself, before you ask any questions. (Puckers up)

>Marian: I take your word.

Harold: Could we sit down?

>Marian: Are all music teachers as dense as I am?

Harold: All music teachers?

>Marian: I daresay you meet dozens — even a hundred —

Harold: Well I —

>Marian: Have they all been fascinated as I have with... the Think System?

Harold: Some more, some less. One young lady had thought up the same system before I got to her town. She showed me a few refinements...

>Marian: I see...

Harold: Have I sad something wrong?

>Marian: Please don't let me keep you, Professor Hill. You must have many more important things to do than to explain the Think System to me.

Harold: Can't think of one.

>Marian: And I must be very dull company for a man of your experience.

Harold: Now saaaay... where'd you get an idea like that?

>Marian: One hears rumors of traveling salesmen.

Harold: Now, Miss Marian — you mustn't believe everything you hear. After all, one even hears rumors about librarians.

>Marian: I suppose you're referring to Uncle Maddy?

H: Uncle Maddy?

>Marian: Mr. Madison — my father's best friend. No matter what they say he left me an assured job so Mother and Winthrop and I would have some security. Surely you don't believe...

Harold: Of course not! That's exactly what I'm saying. But why do you think people start those rumors?

>Marian: Narrow-mindedness, jealousy — jealousy mostly, I guess.

Harold: Exactly. And jealousy mostly starts rumors about traveling salesmen. (Catching her off guard. Quietly) What have you heard?

>Marian: Oh — oh nothing about you personally — just generally —

Harold: What have you heard generally?

>Marian: Just that — (Harold is very close to her) but of course [...] I mean, now honestly — mightn't they?

Harold: Why?

>Marian: (Racing on) And, so you say — if another salesman — or somebody were jealous — I mean — well, they could be downright lies — couldn't they?

Harold: (Confused) What could?

>Marian: Rumors and things.

Harold: Why of course.

>Marian: It just proves you should never believe everything you hear, doesn't it? I mean if you discuss things...

Harold: Miss Marian, I would be delighted to discuss anything in the world with you. But couldn't we do it sitting down? (Trying to lighten her mood) You do sit?... Your knees bend and all.

>Marian: We could sit on the porch steps.

Harold: We could also sit on a large hollow log over't the footbridge.

>Marian: I couldn't think of it. I've never been to the footbridge with a man in my life.

Harold: Just to talk.

>Marian: I've got to dress for the Sociable.

Harold: Then meet me there in fifteen minutes.

>Marian: I just can't — please — some other time — maybe tomorrow.

Harold: My dear little librarian —Pile up enough tomorrows and you'll find you've collected nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you but I'd like to make today worth remembering.

>Marian: Oh — so would I.

Harold: The footbridge — fifteen minutes.

## Scene 4 the Footbridge


Harold: Don't worry, Marce. I'll meet you at the Hotel in plenty a' time. (Marce exits as Marian enters) Miss Marian! (They rush toward each other and meet on the bridge) You're late.

>Marian: But you said fifteen minutes —

Harold: I meant that you were about — Well I'd say — about twenty-six years late — took you all this time to get to the footbridge with a fella.

>Marian: If you want to know the truth it was almost longer.

Harold: Oh?

>Marian: Halfway here I nearly turned back. I suppose I'm not the first to find it easier to think clearly when not under the spell of your salesmanship.

Harold: Now Miss Marian — surely you don't think I've been selling you anything.

>Marian: No — you've given me something. That's why I deceived to come.

Harold: (Bewildered) I don't recall giving —

>Marian: Oh yes, you have! [...] But that's no reason for me not to be grateful for what you will have left behind for me!

Harold: (Beginning to protest) Marian — I —

### Till there was you
>Marian: (sings Till There Was You)


Harold: There's a place over't Madison Park near the Sociable makes this footbridge look like the old ladies home. Now beat it. Go get the rig. (Marcellus exist as Harold returns to Marian) Never a peaceful moment in the music business. (Preparing for the kill) Now then, where were we?

>Marian: You were about to tell me what I don't know about you.

Harold: (Trying to retract) Yeah — well we really don't have to go into that just now — do we —

>Marian: No, we don't — or ever for that matter, Harold. The librarian hasn't felt much like doing research lately — but she did plenty when you first came here.

Harold: (Slightly apprehensive) Oh — about what?

>Marian: About Professor Harold Hill, Gary Conservatory of Music — Gold Medal Class of '05. Harold, there wasn't any Gary Conservatory in '05.

Harold: Why there certainly —

>Marian: Because the town wasn't even built till '06. (Kisses him) I'll see you at the Sociable.

Harold: (Calling after her) You knew all the time?!

>Marian: (Taking a paper from her bosom) Since July 7th — three days after you came. I tore this page out of the Indaiana Journal. (Handing him the paper) It was originally intended to use against you but now I give it to you with all my heart.


## Scene 6


### Chase

Harold: Marian! I've been looking all over for you! Where've you been?

>Marian: (Rushing to him) Harold! I've been looking for Winthrop — he's run away! Please go! Please, Harold, they're even talking about tar and feathers!

Harold: I had to see you, Marian —

>Marian: It's all right! Don't you know that? You don't owe me a word — not a word — Please, hurry, please —

Marcellus: [...] Let's try down by the crick!

>Marian: Winthrop! (Grabbing him. Winthrop breaks away but Harold grabs him)
