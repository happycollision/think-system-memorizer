What? Who....? I don't understand.\n\nADAM\nI got a desperate call on my mobile. She said her husband was trying to kill her. And I rushed over and found her like this.\n\nOSCAR\nKill her – how?\n\nADAM\nPoison, she said.\n\nOSCAR\nPoison?\n\nADAM\nYes.\n\nOSCAR\nShe said her husband?\n\nADAM\nWell someone. Most likely her husband. They detest each other.\n\nOSCAR\nDo they?\n(ADAM NODS)\nAnd.... that's her husband?\n\nADAM\nYes. He was standing right over her. I've never met him, but I know he's a shit.\n\nOSCAR\n(INDIGNANT)\nA shit! Who told you that?\n\nADAM\nShe did.\n\nOSCAR\nWho are you?\n\nADAM\nI'm.... er....\n\nOSCAR\nI know you! You're that actor. In her film.\n\nADAM\nEr... yes.\n\nOSCAR\n(CAUTIOUSLY)\nOf course! So you must be....\n\nADAM\nWho are *you*?\n\nOSCAR\nMe?\n\nADAM\nYes.\n\nOSCAR\nI'm, er....\n\nADAM\nYes?\n\nOSCAR\nHer agent.\n\nADAM\nHer agent?\n\nOSCAR\nYes.\n\nADAM\nAh! You're\nhere for the premiere?\n\nOSCAR\nExactly. I\njust came round to, er.... Tell me....\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nOSCAR\nWhy did she\ncall you?\n\nADAM\nWell, I.... she.... I was the first person she thought of.\n\nOSCAR\nWhy?\n\nADAM\nWell I was working with her. I'm in the next hotel....\n\nOSCAR\nThe Carlton?\n\nADAM\nYes. I rushed straight over.\n\nOSCAR\n(FIERCE)\nYou're her lover, aren't you?\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nOSCAR\nI know she has a lover. You're him.\n\nADAM\nNonsense! I'm just a friend. Working with her.\n\nOSCAR\nWell if you aren't....\n(TURNS TO JIMMY)\nHe must be.\n\nADAM\nThat's her husband.\n\nOSCAR\nAh, yes.\n(TURNS BACK)\nThen it has to be you.\n\nADAM\nMe what?\n\nOSCAR\nHer lover.\n\nADAM\nNo, I told you, I.... How do you know she has a lover?\n\nOSCAR\nI just know.\n\nADAM\nWhat's it to you anyway?\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nYou're just her agent.\n\nOSCAR\nYes, well.... I have to protect my assets.\n\nADAM\nYou haven't protected her very well.\n(GOES TO THE BODY)\nOh, poor Grace....\n(TURNS ON JIMMY)\nYou bastard!\n\nKICKS HIM. JIMMY GROANS AND STIRS\n\nOSCAR\nYou're sure that's her husband?\n\nADAM\nWho else could it be? Grace was afraid he'd try something.\n\nOSCAR\nHow do you know?\n\nADAM\nShe told me. Bastard!\n(KICKS JIMMY AGAIN)\n\nOSCAR\nSteady on. Don't kill him.\n\nADAM\nWe must call the police.\n\nOSCAR\n(HESITATING)\nAh. Well, er....\n\nADAM\nOr perhaps the management.\n\nOSCAR\nYes. Er.... Hang on a moment....\n(THINKS)\n\nADAM\nWhat are you waiting for? We must do something!\n\nOSCAR\nYes, but....\n\nADAM\nThat's his phone!\n(GOES TO JIMMY AND TAKES HIS MOBILE FROM HIS POCKET)\nMessage. 'Don't do it. Leave now.' There! Proof!\n\nOSCAR\nWho's it from?\n\nADAM\n'H'. Who's H?\n\nOSCAR\nI don't know.\n\nADAM\nI can guess.\n\nOSCAR\nWho?\n\nADAM\nSomeone who was in on the plot. His mistress!\n\nOSCAR\nHis mistress?\n\nADAM\nHe has a mistress. She told me.\n\nOSCAR\nShe told you that?\n\nADAM\nYes.\n\nOSCAR\nShe told you an awful lot.\n\nADAM\nWell we've been working together. Closely.\n\nOSCAR\nVery closely. How did she know?\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nOSCAR\nThat her husband has a mistress!\n\nADAM\nShe suspected. Bastard! A wonderful woman like Grace. That's his motive of course.\n\nOSCAR\n'Don't do it – leave now.' Why would his mistress send a message like that?\n\nADAM\nI dunno. Perhaps they planned it together.\n\nOSCAR\nHer murder?\n\nADAM\nThey planned to kill Grace and run off together. Then perhaps she got cold feet. She was telling him not to kill Grace, but just to leave her now.\n\nOSCAR\nLeave her?\n\nADAM\nOn the day of her premiere! *Bastard*!\n\nJIMMY STIRS AND SITS UP\n\nADAM\nDon't you move!\n\nJIMMY\n(DAZED)\nWhat's happened?\n\nADAM\nYou've been rumbled, chum, that's what's happened. You've been caught red-handed at murder, and your mistress is implicated too!\n\nJIMMY\n(BEWILDERED)\nMy mistress?\n\nADAM\nHow could you? A fabulous woman like Grace! Murdered!\n\nOSCAR\nAre you sure she's dead?\n\nADAM\nOf course she is.\n(GOES TO THE BODY)\nShe was already passing out when she phoned me, and....\n\nFEELS HER PULSE. SHE STIRS AND MOANS. HE LEAPS BACK\n\nADAM\nOh my God!\n\nOSCAR\nOh my God!\n\nADAM\nGrace?\n\nGRACE\n(PAUSE. SHE SITS UP GROGGILY. NOT YOUNG BUT STILL GLAMOROUS FILM STAR)\n(DAZED)\nWhat happened?\n\nADAM\nGrace! You're not dead!\n\nGRACE\nI don't think so.\n(LOOKS UP)\nAdam! What are you...?\n\nADAM\nYou called me.\n\nGRACE\nOh yes. I....\n(SEES OSCAR AND JUMPS)\nAh!\n\nOSCAR\nGrace.\n\nGRACE\nWhy are you....?\n(SEES JIMMY AND JUMPS AGAIN)\nAh!!\n\nADAM\nIt's all right. I caught him.\n\nGRACE\nCaught who?\n\nADAM\n(INDICATING JIMMY)\nYour husband. Red-handed.\n\nGRACE\nMy husband?\n\nADAM\nYes.\n(INDICATING OSCAR)\nAnd he's a witness - your agent.\n\nGRACE\nMy agent?\n\nADAM\nWe'll put him away for life!\n\nGRACE\n(FROWNING)\nI, er....\n\nADAM\nHow are you feeling?\n\nGRACE\nAll right, I think. I must have collapsed.\n(WAVERS BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO)\nWho, er....? Why, er....?\n\nADAM\nTake it easy. You're confused.\n\nGRACE\nI'm not sure what's happened here.\n\nADAM\nSomeone tried to poison you – your husband probably - and you called me before you passed out.\n\nGRACE\nAh, yes.\n\nADAM\nHow did he do it?\n\nGRACE\nDo it?\n\nADAM\nPoison you.\n\nGRACE\nPeanuts.\n\nADAM\nPeanuts?\n\nGRACE\nHe knows I'm allergic.\n\nADAM\nAh, yes.\n\nGRACE\n(INDICATING THE LUNCH TRAY)\nHe must have put some in my lunch.\n\nADAM\nProof! The bastard!\n\nTHREATENS JIMMY AGAIN, WHO COWERS AWAY\n\nJIMMY\nNo, no.\n\nADAM\n(TO OSCAR)\nCall the police. We must have him arrested.\n\nOSCAR\nEr.... yes.\n\nJIMMY\nNo, please....\n\nADAM\nCaught in the act. You'll get life for this!\n\nGRACE\nJust a minute.\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nGRACE\nLet's think about it.\n\nADAM\nWhat's there to think about? It's attempted murder. We're all witnesses.\n\nGRACE\nYes, but er.... Well, is it wise?\n\nADAM\nWise?\n\nGRACE\nThe publicity....\n\nADAM\nAh.\n\nOSCAR\nYes, quite! The publicity.\n\nGRACE\nThe middle of the Cannes Film Festival...\n\nOSCAR\nGrace all over the headlines.\n\nADAM\nYes.\n\nOSCAR\nNot a good idea.\n\nADAM\nBut we can't just let him go. He tried to murder her!\n\nJIMMY\nNo, no, I....\n\nADAM\nAnd his mistress was in on it.\n\nGRACE\nHis mistress?\n\nADAM\nYou were right. She tried to stop him. 'H'.\n\nGRACE\nH?\n\nJIMMY\nH?\n\nADAM\nCheck your phone. How can you deny it?\n\nJIMMY\n(LOOKS AT HIS PHONE)\nI, er....\n\nADAM\nWell? More proof!\n\nJIMMY\nThat's not... it's just... I mean... I didn't do anything.\n\nADAM\nDidn't do anything? You fed her peanuts! Knowing they were lethal for her.\n\nJIMMY\nNo, I didn't. It wasn't me.\n\nADAM\nI caught you. Standing right over her.\n\nGRACE\nYou did?\n\nADAM\nYes.\n(TO HIM)\nMinutes after you called me.\n\nJIMMY\nYes, but I... I....\n\nADAM\nYou were the only other person in the apartment. What were you doing if you weren't trying to kill her?\n\nGRACE\nYes, what were you doing?\n\nOSCAR\nYes, what were you doing?\n\nJIMMY\n(AT A LOSS)\nI was, um.... I was just....\n\nADAM\nWhat? What?\n\nJIMMY\nTrying to save her.\n\nADAM\nDon't give me that! She phoned me on the point of collapse. You were trying to poison her with crushed peanuts or peanut oil, or....\n(POINTS AT THE TRAY)\nThe forensics will find it and you'll be hung, drawn and quartered!\n\nOSCAR\nYou seem very concerned for someone who's just a fellow actor.\n\nADAM\nOf course! She nearly died.\n\nGRACE\nAt least someone's concerned.\n\nADAM\nQuite. You're her agent – aren't you concerned?\n\nOSCAR\nWell naturally. But she's all right now. It can't have been a very serious attempt.\n\nGRACE\nOh, thank you very much. That's all right then.\n\nOSCAR\nNo, I didn't mean...\n\nGRACE\nHelp me up....\n\nADAM HELPS HER TO STAND UNSTEADILY\n\nGRACE\nNow let me get this straight.\n(POINTS AT JIMMY)\nThis is my secretive husband who supposedly was trying to poison me....\n\nJIMMY\nNo, no....\n\nADAM\nYou told me he was.\n\nGRACE\n(POINTING AT OSCAR)\nAnd this is my aspiring agent...\n\nADAM\nAspiring?\n\nGRACE\n...who miraculously arrived on the scene at the same time.\n\nOSCAR\nNot quite.\n\nGRACE\nAnd who apparently corroborates your story.\n\nADAM\n(TO OSCAR)\nWell you do, don't you?\n\nOSCAR\n(HESITATING)\nEr....\n\nGRACE\nWell?\n\nOSCAR\nMore or less.\n\nGRACE\nIntriguing.\n(TURNS TO JIMMY)\nAnd what was his motive for trying to murder me?\n\nJIMMY\nI didn't.... I wasn't....\n\nADAM\nHe claimed you had a lover.\n\nGRACE\nReally?\n\nJIMMY\nNo, I didn't!\n\nADAM\nNo.\n(POINTS AT OSCAR)\nHe claimed you had a lover.\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nDon't tell me you haven't had lovers.\n\nOSCAR\nThat's different, I....\n\nGRACE\nOh, I see – one rule for agents and another for clients!\n\nOSCAR\nNot at all. I....\n\nADAM\nI don't quite understand. Something odd is going on here....\n\nOSCAR\nYou'd better keep quiet, you.\n\nGRACE\nHe's every right to speak.\n\nOSCAR\nWhat – as both your leading man and stand-in at the same time, eh?\n\nGRACE\nHe's nothing of the sort, and it's nothing to do with my agent anyway.\n\nOSCAR\n(CONTAINING HIMSELF)\nGrrrr!\n\nGRACE\nIf you want to remain my agent you'd better stay out of this.\n\nADAM\nYes, quite.\n\n( ... )\n\nHAILEY\nI put them off the trail.\n(POINTING TO ADAM)\nI sent them to his hotel instead.\n\nADAM\n(PREENING)\nOh thank you.\n\nGRACE\nNot you. You're my agent.\n(POINTS AT JIMMY)\nWith him.\n\nJIMMY\nMe?\n\nGRACE\nWould the rest of you kindly go next door to the bedroom and do whatever you like to do in bedrooms, while I and my 'husband' have a talk. You can discuss the situation and pretend it's all part of Murder In The Dark.\n\nTHEY ALL STARE AT HER\n\nGRACE\nGo on – shoo!\n\nADAM\nGrace, I....\n\nGRACE\nOut.\n\nOSCAR\nLook here, Grace....\n\nGRACE\nOut, out!\n\nHAILEY HESITATES LOOKING AT JIMMY\n\nHAILEY\nUm....\n\nGRACE\nYou too, sweetheart. You've delivered your non- message – thank you very much. Go and discuss press relations with my agent.\n\nALL\n(THEY ALL LEAVE RELUCTANTLY. SHE TURNS TO FACE JIMMY)\n\n( ... )\n\nOSCAR\nYou see! Resorting to toy-boys now!\n\nMARCHES TO JIMMY AND KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH A PUNCH. JIMMY COLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AGAIN\n\nGRACE\nOh, poor boy!\n\nOSCAR\nHah!\n\nADAM ENTERS\n\nADAM\nWhat's happening?\n\nOSCAR\nI caught them – practically having it off!\n\nADAM\nWhat??\n\nOSCAR\nHe's her lover. I knew all along!\n\nADAM\nI thought he was her husband?\n\nOSCAR\nDon't be fatuous – of course he's not. I am.\n\nADAM\nYou? But I thought....\n\nGRACE\n(TENDING TO JIMMY)\nOh shut up, both of you!\n\nADAM\nI don't understand. This man's your lover?\n\nOSCAR\nYes! Putting your nose out of joint, eh?\n\nADAM\n(TO OSCAR)\nAnd you're her...?\n\nOSCAR\nYes, yes – her very long, very suffering husband. Now shut up!\n\nGRACE\nYou clowns! The poor boy should have you both for grievous bodily harm!\n\nOSCAR\nSo what is he doing here?\n\nGRACE\nWhat – you mean apart from being my lover who's pretending to be my husband, who was trying to murder me?\n\nOSCAR\nOh, for God's sake....!\n\nJIMMY GROANS AND WAKES UP\n\nGRACE\nPoor Jimmy – are you all right?\n\nADAM\nWell who is he?\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\n(POINTING AT ADAM)\nI thought he was my stud.\n\nOSCAR\nI never know with you! Anything in trousers it seems.\n\nGRACE\nHow dare you!\n\nADAM\nYes, how dare you! Speaking of your wife like that.\n\nOSCAR\n(SQUARING UP)\nI'll speak of my wife how I want! It's none of your business.\n\nADAM\n(ALSO SQUARING UP)\nIt's my business if someone insults my leading lady!\n\nOSCAR\nOh yes?\n\nADAM\n(NOSE TO NOSE)\nYes.\n\nOSCAR\nOh yes?\n\nADAM\nYes!\n\nGRACE\nPathetic! Cut it out boys. Save it for the playground.\n\nOSCAR\nGrrrr!\n\nADAM\nGrrrr!\n\nTHEY BREAK APART. HAILEY ENTERS\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nI took it out earlier because I was going to wear it. My necklace – given me by Prince Abdul. It's gone! It's... we've... someone's taken it!\n\nSHE GLARES ROUND THE ROOM\n\nGRACE\nWho?\n\nPAUSE. EVERYONE IS FROZEN\n\nGRACE\nIt must be somebody here.\n\nADAM\nIt could have been the staff.\n\nGRACE\nWho, if he's up to murder, is probably up to theft as well....\n\nOSCAR\nLudicrous!\n\nGRACE\nMy leading man, who's earning almost as much as I am, but has big tax problems....\n\nADAM\nAbsurd!\n\nGRACE\nAnd who got here from his hotel remarkably quickly....\n\nADAM\nWell of course I did!\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nNo? Well then, so be it.\n(PROCLAIMS)\n'Once more unto the breach, and let loose the hounds of war!'\n\nADAM\nDogs.\n\nGRACE\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nDogs of war. That's what Shakespeare wrote.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nSo, I will leave the explication of all the identities for the moment - the first thing is to search everyone.\n\nALL\n(PROTESTING)\nOh no.... that's not on.... you can't demand that.... (ETC)\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nEnough!\n(PATS DOWN OSCAR)\nThank you, monsieur. Please stand aside. Now, the actor.\n(INDICATES ADAM)\nThis one, yes?\n\nGRACE\nYes.\n\nBONIFACE\nPlease monsieur.\n\nADAM\n(RELUCTANTLY)\nI object to this.\n\nEMPTIES HIS POCKETS\n\nBONIFACE\nWallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....\n\nOSCAR\nHah!\n\nBONIFACE\n....packet of unmentionables. Small size.\n\nOSCAR\n(TO GRACE)\nNow who's the pot calling the kettle black?\n\nGRACE\nNothing to do with me.\n\nOSCAR\n(THREATENING ADAM)\nWell I can't think what else they're for.\n\nADAM\nEmergencies – just like you.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nPlease, monsieur. I will decide who is likely.\n(TO JIMMY)\nMonsieur.\n\nJIMMY EMPTIES HIS POCKETS\n\nBONIFACE\nWallet, phone, handkerchief with lipstick....\n\nALL\nAha!\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nPerhaps. So now we try the actor's.\n(PRESSES BUTTONS. GRACE'S PHONE ON THE DESK BUZZES)\nAha! Madame's phone, yes?\n\nOSCAR\nI knew it! He's her lover!\n\nADAM\nNonsense! I was....\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nTrying to call her back after she passed out.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nWhose is this?\n(LOOKS AT JIMMY)\nYours monsieur.\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nHis?\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nSo – your wife took a position with Monsieur Gervaise, so was able to inform you when Madame Gervaise was alone in the hotel, so you could invade her rooms and discover a celebrity story.\n\nJIMMY\nEr... something like that.\n\nBONIFACE\nAnd perhaps steal celebrity sparklers also?\n\nJIMMY\nNo!\n\nBONIFACE\n(HOLDING UP THE BALACLAVA)\nIs this balaclava hat yours?\n\nJIMMY\nNo - never seen it before.\n\nADAM\nJust a minute!\n\nBONIFACE\nWhat?\n\nADAM\n(TO HAILEY)\nWhat's your name?\n\nHAILEY\nHailey.\n\nADAM\nAha! H! The message was from you.\n\nBONIFACE\nWhat message?\n\nADAM\nOn his phone. It came through just after I caught him. 'Don't do it. Leave now.'\n\n( ... )\n\nJIMMY\nI, er... didn't want anyone to know I was a journalist.\n\nOSCAR\nBecause....\n(INDICATING ADAM)\nI found him here, and he didn't know I was her husband, and I wanted to find out what he was doing here.\n\nADAM\nOh, really?\n\nOSCAR\nYes, really.\n\nADAM\nGrrrr!\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\n(PROCLAIMING)\nAnd finally - when everybody got here to the hotel, which one arrived wearing a balaclava hat, in time to put poison in Madame Gervaise's Caesar Salad??\n\nGRACE\nYes. Who?\n\nALL\n(EVERYONE LOOKS AT EVERYONE ELSE)\n\nBONIFACE\nOf course the answer is...\n\nGRACE\nWhat?\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nYes, that's everyone. And peanuts are easy to acquire.\n\nGRACE\nFrom your bar!\n\nBONIFACE\nFrom anyone's bar.\n(TO ADAM)\nYours for instance.\n\nADAM\nRidiculous!\n\nBONIFACE\nWhy?\n\nADAM\nI'm her l... leading man. I'm completely innocent.\n\nBONIFACE\nNobody is innocent, monsieur, until I have found them not guilty.\n\nADAM\nYou aren't the law here, Monsieur Boniface. We should have called the police – I said so in the first place.\n\nBONIFACE\nWe do not need the police until I, Hercule Poirot of the Riviera, have discovered the culprits. Then we will decide how to handle the situation. Now – Madame Gervaise.\n\nGRACE\nYes?\n\nBONIFACE\nWhat time did your husband leave this morning for his office?\n\nGRACE\nAbout nine oclock.\n\nBONIFACE\nToo early to put peanuts in your salad.\n\nADAM\nUnless he nipped back later in his balaclava.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nMonsieur actor.\n\nADAM\nYes?\n\nBONIFACE\nWhere were you this morning before you got the call for help from Madame Gervaise?\n\nADAM\nAt my hotel – eating peanuts.\n\nBONIFACE\nWhy aren't you staying at this hotel?\n\nADAM\nBecause that's a better hotel.\n\nBONIFACE\n(INDIGNANT)\nThere is no better hotel in Cannes than this hotel!\n\nOSCAR\nI'll tell you why. Because it would be too obvious he was having an affair with my wife if he stayed at the same hotel.\n\nBONIFACE\nIs this true?\n\nADAM\nCertainly not!\n\nBONIFACE\nBut you could have come to this hotel earlier, with your peanuts, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned Madame Gervaise's salad, and stolen her necklace at the same time.\n\nADAM\nThat's nonsense! If I'm having an affiar with her, why would I want to poison her?\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nEither one of these monsieurs, or madame bimbo, entered the apartment earlier by the balcony, wearing the balaclava hat, poisoned madame's lunch when she was in the bedroom, stole her necklace, and left again.\n\nADAM\nLeft again?\n\nBONIFACE\nWith the necklace, because it's not here. And then – this is the clever part - returned later to prove innocence. Voila the scenario!\n\nOSCAR\nThen why would they leave the balaclava?\n\nBONIFACE\n(DEFLATED)\nAh.\n(BRIGHTENS)\nThey forgot to take it with them – proving they are an amateur. Which is all of you – amateurs!\n\nADAM\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\nBONIFACE\nWhy not?\n\nADAM\nWhy would any one of us wish to poison a big film star like Grace, on the day of her premiere, and steal her jewellery at the same time, knowing that the whole world would then be on their tail?\n\n> ACT 2 <\n\nTHE SAME, LATE THAT EVENING. THE ROOM IS IN DARKNESS, LIT ONLY BY MOONLIGHT FROM THE FRENCH WINDOWS. A DARK FIGURE APPEARS ON THE BALCONY. PEERS IN, RATTLES THE FRENCH WINDOWS AND ENTERS. IT IS JIMMY IN HIS DARK CLOTHES AND BALACLAVA.\n\nJIMMY\n(LOW VOICE)\nHello? Anyone here?\n\nTAKES OFF THE BALACLAVA, GOES TO THE WASTE BIN AND PEERS IN. LIFTS IT UP AND SHAKES IT. IT IS EMPTY\n\nJIMMY\nBugger!\n\nLOOKS AROUND THE ROOM. AT THAT MOMENT THE SUITE DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND GRACE AND ADAM ENTER, SINGING AND DOING A TANGO TOGETHER. THEY ARE PRETTY SLOSHED. THEY TANGO AROUND THE SOFA AS JIMMY FLATTENS HIMSELF AGAINST THE WALL. AS HE SIDLES TOWARDS THE SUITE DOOR OSCAR AND HAILEY BURST IN, ALSO DOING A TANGO. JIMMY IS FORCED TO RETREAT. THE TWO COUPLES CIRCLE THE ROOM IN RIOTOUS FASHION, ONE OF THEM FLICKING ON THE LIGHTS AS THEY PASS. JIMMY COWERS BACK AGAINST THE WALL\n\nGRACE\nTarararah!! What a night!\n\nADAM\nWhat a wonderful night!\n\nGRACE\nThe film is a sensation – Palme d'Or here we come! Helen Mirren eat your heart out!\n\nADAM\nMeryl Streep – time to retire!\n\nHAILEY\nWooooo!\n\nSHE SUDDENLY NOTICES JIMMY HIDING BY THE WALL. FRANTICALLY WAVES HIM TOWARDS THE DOOR, AT THE SAME TIME TWISTING OSCAR'S BACK TO HIM. JIMMY CREEPS TOWARDS THE OPEN DOOR\n\nGRACE\nAdam, order champagne!\n\nOSCAR\nMore champagne?\n\nGRACE\nThe night is young! The moon is bright! The stars are shining!\n\nADAM\nNone brighter than yours! And mine of course.\n\nGRACE\nNext stop the Golden Globes!\n\nOSCAR\nThen the Oscars!\n\nADAM\n(ON THE PHONE)\nChampagne please – two bottles to Grace Gervaise's suite.\n\nJUST AS JIMMY REACHES THE DOORWAY GRACE SEES HIM\n\nGRACE\nOh look, it's our little paparazzi man! Following us around, are you, Jimmy boy?\n\nJIMMY IS CAUGHT IN THE DOORWAY AS IF HE HAS JUST ARRIVED. SHE WAVES HIM IN\n\nGRACE\nCome in and join the party. We're celebrating!\n\nJIMMY\nEr....\n\nOSCAR\nThe film is a success!\n\nADAM\nThe performance of Grace's life!\n\nGRACE\nYes!\n\nADAM\nAnd mine too of course.\n\nJIMMY\n(HESITATING IN THE DOORWAY)\nOh, good.\n\nGRACE\nThere's your story, paparazzi man. Tell the world!\n\nADAM\nWrite the headlines!\n\nGRACE\nCome in, come in! Rescue your wife from my husband's lecherous clutches.\n\nJIMMY\nWell, er.....\n\nHE HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND HIS BACK AND COMES BACK INTO THE ROOM\n\nGRACE\n(TO ADAM)\nWe're going to party all night, aren't we lover?\n\nADAM\nYes!\n\nGRACE\nUntil the critics bring us back to earth of course.\n\nOSCAR\nAs they always do.\n\nADAM\nStuff the critics!\n\nOSCAR\nBugger the critics!\n\nGRACE\nTo hell with the lot of them! What do they know?\n\nHAILEY IS SIGNALLING QUESTIONS TO JIMMY. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND GESTURES HOPELESSLY. HIDES THE BALACLAVA BEHIND A SOFA CUSHION. GRACE IS DANCING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO ADAM\n\nGRACE\nMmmm! The audience loved me – that's what matters.\n\nADAM\n(HIS HAND ON HER BOTTOM)\nThey adored you!\n\nGRACE\nYes!\n\nADAM\nAnd me of course.\n\nGRACE\nMmmmm!\n\nADAM\nAhhhh!\n\nOSCAR\nYes, well you can stop adoring each other. Take your hands off my wife's bottom, gigolo!\n\nADAM\nHey!\n\nGRACE\nYou take your eyes off the bimbo's bust.\n\nHAILEY\n(ROLLING HER EYES)\nOhhhh!\n\nGRACE\nTonight is my night! Nothing is going to spoil its glory.\n\nADAM\nNothing!\n\nOSCAR\nAren't you forgetting something?\n\nGRACE\nWhat?\n\nOSCAR\nA certain missing necklace.\n\n49\nDEFLATING\n\nGRACE\nOh yes.\n\nADAM\nOh yes, that.\n\nGRACE\nWhy did you remind me? My beautiful necklace!\n\nJIMMY\nYou, er... still haven't found it?\n\nGRACE\nOf course I haven't, silly boy. I'd be wearing it, wouldn't I?\n(THEATRICAL)\nThe prince will never forgive me!\n(WEEPS)\nIt's a tragedy!\n\nADAM\nThere now, Grace, it'll turn up.\n\nGRACE\nHow? Where? It's gone for ever! The thing I loved most in the whole world!\n\nOSCAR\nOh, thanks very much.\n\nGRACE\nIt was worth ten of you, you bimbo bonker!\n\nHAILEY\nOhhh!\n\nOSCAR\nThat's rich coming from you – gigolo juggler!\n\nADAM\nHey!\n\nGRACE\nHot totty tippler!\n\nOSCAR\nSmarmy stud smoocher!\n\nGRACE\nYou're drunk!\n\nOSCAR\nSo are you!\n\nGRACE\nI hate you!\n\nOSCAR\nI despise you!\n\nHAILEY\nHey – stop it!\n\nADAM\nCut it out! We don't want more attempted murders – we've had one already.\n\n( ... )\n\nJIMMY\nI didn't think you'd want it to, er....\n\nGRACE\nMy husband certainly wouldn't. But never mind. My wonderful film is the real story! The coup de Grace!\n\nGRABS ADAM AND TWIRLS\n\nGRACE\nTara!!!\n\nADAM\nTara!!\n\nHAILEY GOES TO JIMMY TO CONFER IN A CORNER, JUST AS MONSIEUR BONIFACE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY WITH TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE IN ICE BUCKETS\n\nBONIFACE\nFelicitations a tout le monde!\n\nGRACE\nMonsieur Boniface!\n\nBONIFACE\nI hear the premiere is a big success! I bring you champagne myself to celebrate. Courtesy of the Hotel Superb.\n\nOSCAR\nWell thank you!\n\nADAM\nWonderful!\n\nBONIFACE BRINGS THE CHAMPAGNE TO THE SIDE TABLE\n\nBONIFACE\nAll of Cannes is talking about it. Do we have glasses?\n(POINTS TO THE SIDE)\nYes.\n\nOSCAR FETCHES THE GLASSES. HAILEY ASSISTS\n\nBONIFACE\nI am told madame's performance is a wonder to behold!\n\nGRACE\nWell of course....\n\nADAM\nAnd mine too.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\n(RAISES GLASS)\nThe Gervaises!\n\nALL\n(RAISING GLASSES)\nThe Gervaises!\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nMy God! Perhaps he was here when I was murdered!\n\nOSCAR\nAlmost murdered.\n\nADAM\nPerhaps he was the murderer.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nPerhaps for distraction. Perhaps to make way for the theft. Who knows? They say these people are extremely ruthless.\n\nOSCAR\nMy god!\n\nADAM\nThat's terrible.\n\nBONIFACE\nHowever – everyone here is still a suspect until the true suspects are proved guilty and the false suspects are proved innocent!\n\nOSCAR\nFatuous!\n\nADAM\nPreposterous!\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nMadame, monsieur! This is not the way for imminent show business people to behave. Especially in front of the press.\n\nJIMMY\nNo, quite.\n\nGRACE\nWell it's time the press exposed my sham of a husband.\n\nOSCAR\nAnd my mockery of a wife.\n\nBONIFACE\nPlease, please – these are not the kinds of stories we want in the papers.\n(TO ADAM)\nYou agree, monsieur?\n\nADAM\nAbsolutely. A little discretion, please!\n\nOSCAR\nYou keep out of this! It's none of your business, you ham actor!\n\nADAM\nHam actor! How dare you, you... you....\n\nAT THAT MOMENT HE GRABS HIS THROAT AND EMITS A TERRIBLE CHOKING SOUND\n\nBONIFACE\nMonsieur? What is the matter?\n\nADAM\nI... I'm....\n\nCOLLAPSES ONTO THE FLOOR AND CONVULSES.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nOh, this is a calamity! This is a cataclysm!\n(ALMOST WEEPING)\nMy hotel will be ruined! Nobody will ever wish to stay here again!\n\nGRACE\nNonsense, Monsieur Boniface - they'll all flock to see the scene of the crime. You'll be famous!\n\nADAM\n(AT THAT MOMENT ADAM APPEARS SHAKILY IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY)\nHello everyone. What's going on?\n\nBONIFACE\n(STUNNED)\nMonsieur!!\n\nGRACE\nAdam! My lover!\n\nADAM\nI heard bangs.\n\nGRACE\n(RUSHING TO HIM)\nYou're alive!\n\nADAM\nOf course I'm alive.\n\nBONIFACE\nBut you were poisoned, monsieur!\n\nADAM\nRubbish. I just had an attack. I'm an epileptic. It happens sometimes when I'm stressed.\n\nOSCAR\nAn eciplect... a plecipept... ?\n\nADAM\nIt knocks me out for a few moments, that's all. Nothing too serious.\n\nGRACE\nOh, thank heavens! I thought I'd lost you.\n\nADAM\n'Fraid not, old girl. Still here to do your next film.\n\nBONIFACE\nBut this is insane! She has killed her husband!\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nBONIFACE\nShe thought he had poisoned you.\n\nADAM\n(STARING AT OSCAR'S BODY)\nYou killed Oscar?\n\nBONIFACE\nShe shot him. In front of me. In front of the paparazzi!\n\nADAM\nOh my God, Grace! You shot him? What have you done??\n\nBONIFACE\nIt is the end of everything!\n\nADAM\nYou'll go to prison for life!\n\nGRACE\n(CALMLY)\nOh stop making such a drama of it. He's all right.\n\nADAM\nWhat?\n\nBONIFACE\nWhat?\n\nGRACE\n(HOLDING UP THE GUN)\nIt's the prop gun from the film. It only fires blanks.\n(TO OSCAR)\nGet up, you pansy! There's nothing wrong with you!\n\nOSCAR STIRS AND SITS UP. EVERYONE GASPS\n\nOSCAR\nOh well, that was quite fun, wasn't it?\n\nADAM\nWhat the...?\n\n( ... )\n\nEVERYONE TURNS TO LOOK. SHE PASSES OUT ON THE FLOOR. THEY RUSH TO HER\n\nBONIFACE\nNo, no, no! Not another one!\n\nGRACE\nOh, the poor bimbo! What's the matter with her?\n\nOSCAR\nShe can't be epileptic too.\n\nADAM\nShe's been poisoned!\n\n( ... )\n\nJIMMY\nYes, but nobody's died. We're all here. Everything's all right.\n\nHAILEY\nYou promise?\n\nJIMMY\nYes, yes.\n\nOSCAR\nThis is beyond a joke!\n\nADAM\nHear, hear.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\nSo much so that he gives you priceless necklaces and holidays on his yacht. What else does he love about you, eh?\n\nGRACE\nMy vital measurements too of course.\n\nOSCAR\nHah!\n\nADAM\nOh for heaven's sake you two, cut it out!\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nI put it here I tell you! I was going to put it in its case, and then Adam distracted everyone.\n(TO ADAM)\nThis is your fault!\n\nADAM\nOh please!\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\n(RESIGNED)\nSearch the room everyone!\n\nALL\n(THEY ALL SEARCH THE ROOM, JIMMY AND HAILEY PRETENDING TO JOIN IN)\n\nGRACE\nThe doors are all closed. No-one has left. It has to be here!\n\nOSCAR\nIt isn't.\n\nADAM\nNothing.\n\n( ... )\n\nBONIFACE\n(COLLAPSING ONTO THE SOFA)\nI think I am imagining this whole day. I think it is a reverie from which I will soon awake.\n(DISCOVERS THE BALACLAVA)\nWait a minute. What is this? Another balaclava!\n(HOLDS IT UP)\n\nADAM\nIt's the same one.\n\n( ... )\n\nOSCAR\nThere now, Grace, calm down. It's only jewellery.\n\nGRACE\nOnly jewellery! It's the most beautiful thing I ever owned!\n\nADAM\nIt'll turn up. We all saw it and nobody's gone out. It can't have gone far, can it Monsieur Boniface?\n\nBONIFACE\n(SHRUGGING)\nThey are so clever these Riviera thieves. They have such tricks. Maybe this time they somehow.... What do you think, Mr Paparazzi man?\n\nJIMMY\nIt's a mystery. What do you think, Hailey?\n\nHAILEY\nIt's incredible. They've really got away with it!\n\nBONIFACE\nWhat can I say? Even I am bimboozled.\n\nGRACE\n(RECOVERING)\nOh well - easy come, easy go.\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nADAM\nWhat are you saying?\n\nGRACE\n(OFFHAND)\nIt doesn't really matter. It wasn't worth anything anyway.\n\nOSCAR\nWhat do you mean?\n\nGRACE\nIt wasn't the real necklace. It was a replica.\n\nJIMMY\nWhat?\n\nHAILEY\nWhat?\n\nGRACE\nI never wear the real thing – it's too valuable.\n\nBONIFACE\nIt wasn't...! Where is the real one?\n\nGRACE\nIn your hotel safe, Monsieur Boniface. Where I trust it's really safe. Unless your chef has access to it.\n\nALL\n(GASPS OF INCREDULITY ALL ROUND. JIMMY AND HAILEY ROLL EYES AT EACH OTHER)\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nDon't be such a defeatist, Monsieur Poirot of the Riviera. This cannot be insoluble. Adam, I put you in charge of investigations. Retrace everyone's movements second by second from the time you collapsed.\n\nADAM\nWhy me?\n\nGRACE\nBecause you're the only one who couldn't have taken it. You were unconscious.\n\nOSCAR\nNo! He woke up before the theft was discovered.\n\nGRACE\nSo what? He was half ga-ga.\n\nOSCAR\nA clever ploy.\n\nGRACE\nDon't be silly. Adam, carry on.\n\nADAM\n(RESIGNED)\nVery well, if you say so.\n\nGRACE\nStart with my husband.\n\nOSCAR\nLudicrous! I steal my own wife's imitation jewels?\n\nGRACE\nYou didn't know they were imitation. I never told you because I never trusted you.\n\nOSCAR\nOh, thank you very much. That's....\n\nGRACE\nSilence! Adam.\n\nADAM\n(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY)\nAll right. Oscar, tell the company what you did when I collapsed?\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nI wasn't pissed.\n\nOSCAR\nYou're still pissed now.\n\nGRACE\nNonsense - I'm perfectly sober.\n\nOSCAR\nYou're never sober. You don't know what sober means. You....\n\nADAM\nQuiet!! Or I'll murder you both myself!\n(THEY RETREAT)\nAnyway, I don't see how he can have done it. He was on the floor half the time.\n\nGRACE\nAll right, we'll come back to him. What about Monsieur Boniface?\n\nBONIFACE\nMe??\n\nGRACE\nWhen I went into the bedroom you were left alone in here with the necklace.\n\nBONIFACE\n(SIGHING)\nAh mon dieu! Now I am a jewel thief.\n\nADAM\nWell we never actually searched you, did we Monsieur Boniface?\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nAll right. Now the paparazzi man and his bimbo.\n\nHAILEY\nOhh!\n\nJIMMY\nPlease stop calling my wife a bimbo.\n\nGRACE\nSorry. The paparazzi man and his totty.\n\nHAILEY\nUh!\n\nADAM\n(TO JIMMY)\nWell? What were your movements?\n\nJIMMY\n(INDICATING OSCAR)\nWell, the same as his. We helped carry you in there. We didn't come back until the shots.\n\nGRACE\nAh, but then what?\n\nJIMMY\nWell, we.... we....\n\nHAILEY\nWe watched him (ADAM) come back from the dead, and then we watched him (OSCAR) come back from the dead, and then we watched her and him (GRACE AND OSCAR) continue to try and kill each other, and then I fainted, and then we watched Monsieur Boniface quietly losing his mind.\n\nBONIFACE\nYes, thank you. I haven't found it yet.\n\nADAM\n(TO GRACE)\nWell that hasn't proved anything. We're still no closer.\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nI think little Jimmy and his pretty partner can tell us.\n\nEVERYONE STARES AT THE PAIR\n\nBONIFACE\nEh?\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nJIMMY\nUs?\n\nGRACE\nYes, you, you pseudo paparazzi man. You clever pair of innocents. You're no journalist. She's no secretary. You're the Riviera jewel thieves, aren't you?\n\nHAILEY\nUs?\n\nGRACE\nYou think you can pull the wool over my eyes? Me, the expert on every convoluted film plot ever written? The star of half the crime melodramas ever made? I rumbled you two the moment you met here.\n\nBONIFACE\nIs this true? You are the Riviera jewel thieves?\n\nJIMMY\n(BASHFUL)\nWell.... I suppose there's no point in denying it now.\n\nOSCAR\nGood God!\n\nADAM\nBloody hell!\n\n( ... )\n\nOSCAR\n(POINTING AT ADAM)\nIs he your lover, or isn't he your lover?\n\nGRACE\nOf course he's not my lover.\n\nADAM\nOf course I'm not her lover.\n\nOSCAR\nHow do I know that?\n\nGRACE\nHe blows the other way, you fool!\n\nOSCAR\nWhat?\n\nGRACE\nHe's gay. He's a poof. Aren't you, Adam?\n\nADAM\nYeh.\n\nOSCAR\nYou're gay?\n\nADAM\nBent as a hairpin. But don't tell my fans.\n\n( ... )\n\nGRACE\nWe're not really such a bad team, are we?\n\nOSCAR\nNo. Oh, I'm relieved! I didn't really want to lose you.\n\nGRACE\nOf course you didn't. Where else would you find a prima donna like me to brighten your life?\n\nADAM\nExactly.\n\nGRACE\nYou'd be bored to death without me to dramatise our affairs.\n\nOSCAR\nAnd you'd be lost without me to manage your affairs.\n\nGRACE\nOf course I would.\n(THEY CLASP EACH OTHER)\n\nOSCAR\nAhhh!\n\nGRACE\nAhh!\n\nADAM\n(CLAPPING)\nHurrah! All friends again.\n"}
