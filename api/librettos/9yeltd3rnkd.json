Is not moving her date?\n\n> Emma: Well, you amaze me, Liv. You really do. You-You never ask me what I want. You just figure you know best, end of story. \"Emma, wear this. Emma, say that.\" Well, Emma's pretty frickin' tired of it.\n\nLiv: Oh, whoa.\n\n> Emma: Don't think I didn't notice how totally freaked out you were because I had the nerve to get engaged before you did.\n\nLiv: Okay, wait! First of all, Daniel bought that ring in December. Okay? So officially, I was first.\n\n> Emma: Oh, pathetic. Pathetic!\n\nLiv: Second, people always make you do things you don't wanna do. Emma, it's like you don't have a spine. Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have a spine.\n\n> Emma: Wow. No one could accuse you of being soft, Liv. You grabbed the first date in June Marion offered... without even asking me first.\n\nLiv: At least I'm not so terrified of being alone...that I people-please my way through life. Emma, you settle.\n\n> Emma: Are you saying that I'm settling with Fletcher?\n\nLiv: I wasn't thinking about Fletcher. You came up with that one on your own.\n\n> Emma: Ooh. Move your date, Liv.\n\nLiv: You move your date, Emma.\n\n> Emma: It's done. You lose.\n\nLiv: Your wedding better watch it.\n\n> Emma: What did you just say?\n\nLiv: I said your wedding should be very scared right now. If I were your wedding, I'd sleep with one eye open.\n\n> Emma: Why don't you just save your threats for Daniel? After all, isn't that how you got a proposal out of him?\n\nLiv: Your wedding can suck it.\n\n> Emma: What did you just say? My wedding can suck it?\n\nLiv: I said your wedding can suck it.\n\n> Emma: Your wedding can s... be... I mean, yours can be, um... Can-Can be, uh...\n\nLiv: Bye, ladies.\n\n> Emma: Hey, Liv.\n\nLiv: Yes.\n\n> Emma: Your wedding will be huge. Just like your ass at prom.\n\nLiv: We're done.\n\n> Emma: So Done.\n\nLiv: Hmm. Good.\n"}
