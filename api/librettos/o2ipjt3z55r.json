You have something against Connie Francis?\n\nCORNY\nThe kids are just over the moon for rhythm and blues, Velma. They can't get enough.\n\n...\n\nVELMA\nAh, ah, ah! None of that! Save your personal lives for the camera! And we're back in five... four... three...\n\nThe lights change to indicate we're back on the air\n\nCORNY\nNow don't forget, guys and Gidgets — our very first primetime spectacular is coming up on June 6th. We'll be live at Baltimore's brand-new Eventorium broadcasting nationwide! Talent scouts will be on hand from all of the major record labels, and sponsoring the event will be none other than our own ULTRA CLUTCH HAIRSPRAY.

And I want to be your Miss Teenage Hairspray. Remember, a vote for me from you is a vote for me.\n\nCORNY\nWhat an unexpected ad lib, Amber. And it speaking of expecting the unexpected, our own a fun loving, freewheeling Brenda will be taking a little leave of absence from the show. How long will you be gone, Brenda?\n\nBRENDA\nNine months.\n\nCORNY\nSo, it seems we'll have an opening for a girl who is just as fun-loving, but maybe not quite as freewheeling. Wanna be one of the nicest kids in town? Cut school tomorrow and come down to station WZZT to audition!\n\n.SCENE 5 - THE MADISON\n\nPatterson Park High School gymnasium. Corny takes the mic.\n\nCORNY\nHey, there, sophomores and sophomores at heart. I'm honored to be your guest DJ here at PPHS.

And that was our dance of the week — \"Peyton Place After Midnight,\" introduced to you by our brand-new Council member, Miss Tracy Turnblad.\n\n...\n\nEDNA\nShe can't hear you.\n(the phone rings and she answers it.)\nHello?... Yes. This is her childhood home. No I'm not her father.\n\nCORNY\nSo let's wave a wistful bye-bye to Brenda — see you next year.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBERS\nAwww...\n\nCORNY\n...and inaugurate the newest member of our Council, Tracy Turnblad! Cozy up to old Corny and tell us about yourself, Trrrrace.\n\nTRACY\nWell, I go to Patterson Park High, I watch your show, and do absolutely nothing else.\n(all applaud and cheer)\nBut someday I hope to be the first woman president of the world or a Rockette. You got to think big to be big!\n\nCORNY\nAnd if you were president, what would your first official act be?\n\nTRACY\nWell, I'd make every day Negro Day!\n\nVELMA & SPRITZER\nAaaaaiiieeeeeee!!!!!!\n\nCORNY\nI read you like tomorrow's headlines, Trace! What do you say, kids? Looks like we might just have a hot new candidate for Miss Teenage Hairspray.\n\nAMBER\n(grabbing the mic)\nno, she can't be miss hairspray! She's the before in the Metrecal diet ad, and I'm the after, and afters always win!\n\nCORNY\nAmber, what the comedian!\n(bonks Amber on the head)\nSo, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\n\nAMBER\n(grabbing the mic)\nNo! He can't because everyone knows that whenever he sings, he sings to me, he's completely involved with me, see?\n\nCORNY\nRight. So, Tracy, tell us true, how would you like Link Larkin to sing a song just for you?\n\nTRACY\nWould I? Would I?\n\nAMBER\n(grabbing the mic)\nYou people are ignoring the laws of nature!\n\nCORNY\nLink Larkin, our own budding Elvis, will now sing to the equally blooming Tracy Turnblad his version of this week's Top 40 hit, \"It Takes Two.\"\n\n...\n\nSPRITZER\nMrs. Von Tussle, Negro Day everyday? That chubby communist girl and kissing on the mouth with possibly parted lips... I assure you, controversy is not what Ultra Clutch wishes to promote.\n\nCORNY\nNegroes and chubby girls buy hairspray, too, Mr. Spritzer.\n\nSPRITZER\nMrs. Von Tussle, how do you plan to handle this?\n\nVELMA\nI plan to start by firing him!\n\nCORNY\nYou can't fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collings Show.\n\nVELMA\nWhy not? They do it all the time on Lassie!\n\nCORNY\nMr. Spritzer, to keep your audience, you got to keep up with the times.\n\nVELMA\nThis show's fine the way it is.\n\nCORNY\nBringing Tracy on is just beginning. I've got terrific ideas for updating the show.\n\nSPRITZER\nI'm getting one of my sick headaches. Is there a place where I might lie down?\n\nVELMA\nThere's a bed in my office.\n(Spritzer leaves)\nSo you've got ideas, do you? And going behind my back to put this no talent Commie on the show is one of them?\n\nCORNY\nDamn right, Velma. It's time we put kids on the show who looks like the kids who watch the show.\n\nVELMA\nNot while I'm producing it.\n\nCORNY\nI was thinking it might be time to change that, too.\n\nVELMA\nAre you threatening me, Collins?\n\nCORNY\nAw, you know me, Velma! On the other hand, I could always take the show to Channel 11.\n(Corny exits laughing)\n\n> ACT 2 <\n\n.SCENE 5 - MISS TEENAGE HAIRSPRAY\n\nDrum Roll...

And coming back to Corny on camera one in 3...2...\n\nCORNY\nAnd now for the talent portion of the competition where the frontrunner gals present a dance of their own creation.\n(looking at the scoreboard)\nPresently, it appears Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad are neck and neck. But since, according to the latest police bulletins, Miss Turnblad is still at large...\n\nAMBER\nAt VERY large.\n\nCORNY\n...our Miss Hairspray might just be a foregone conclusion. Still, our rules say contestants have to dance for it. Are you ready, Amber?\n\n...\n\nAMBER\nThank you ladies, gentlemen and kids. I'm now ready to consume the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray.\n\nCorny leads Spritzer on. Spritzer carries the crown and bouquet.\n\nCORNY\nJust to be sure, I think we'd better check the board.\n\nSPRITZER\nCould we please see the tally?\n\nall turn to the board and amber wins by a few votes\n\nSPRITZER\nYes, Amber Von Tussle just squeaks in as the winner.\n\nAMBER\nWhat did I tell you? Give me the crown, give me the flowers, and everybody start bowing!\n\nTRACY\nNot so fast, Amber. Look who's coming in the front door.\n\nCORNY\nRight on schedule! I mean, I know nothing about this complex plan. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the never to be counted out Tracy Turnblad.\n\n...\n\n.AFTER: YOU CAN'T STOP THE BEAT\n\napplause\n\nCORNY\nEveryone, look... Look at the scoreboard!\n(all look)\nTracy Turnblad, I declare you Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962!\n\n...\n\nTRACY\nOf course you, Link. But I also want a graduate degree in Musicology with a minor in the ethnic studies. And if there's something else I'd like to say - The Corny Collins Show is now and forever more officially integrated!\n(Cheers fill the room)\n\nCORNY\nAmerica look up! Here's history right before your eyes. Television will never be the same.\n\n...\n\nPRUDY\nAnd you look so happy. I can't say it's what I want, but if this fine looking cat-like black boy is responsible for the light in your eyes, then how could I object?\n\nCORNY\nLive television - there's nothing like it.\n"}
